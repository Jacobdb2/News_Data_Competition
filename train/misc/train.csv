									Reputed Testicle-Eating Fish with Human-Like Teeth Caught in Michigan

Wildlife officials aren’t as worried about men’s testicles as they are how the tropical fish ended up in Lake St. Clair to begin with.

Pacus earned their nasty reputation for feasting on male genitalia after Animal Planet host Jeremy Wade featured them on “River Monsters” in 2011. The story of two Amazonian fishermen who died after their testicles were bitten off by pacus went wild on the internet.

The legend grew when the pacu reportedly showed up in Denmark three years ago, leading a fish expert at Denmark’s University of Copenhagen to warn male swimmers against skinny dipping in the Baltic waters. And in Papua New Guinea in the southwestern Pacific, the invasive species is blamed for castrating a couple of local fishermen.

									An 8 year old child caught stealing bread in a market of Iran is punished in a public place, in the name of Islam!!!

His arm will be crushed and will lose its use permanently.  A religion of peace and love, they say?  How can anyone believe them
when they commit such inhuman acts?



Dear Friends,

My first reaction to these pictures was ""I don´t believe this, it must be a photographic trick"".

Unfortunately, the truth seems evident, a little boy gets punished because he has stolen bread and they drive a heavy vehicle over his arm ....

What do you do when you receive a series of pictures like this? You ignore them???? Delete and think, thank God I am not living in Iran? This does not happen in my world ....

But the world is OURS - whether we live in Portugal, Sweden or in Iran. OUR children grow up in this world.

I feel helpless but I don´t want to think I received these pictures for no reason. Therefore, let´s use the power of the computer and internet to spread the information around the world. Maybe it can save some children from abuse in the future ...???

Ignorance can be defeated .... And the internet is a wonderful weapon.

There are hundreds of places like this in the world today and they keep on piling up...

THE WORLDS UNSOLD CAR STOCKPILE

Houston...We have a problem!... Nobody is buying brand new cars anymore!  Well they are, but not on the scale they once were.  Millions of brand new unsold cars are just sitting redundant on runways and car parks around the world.  There, they stay, slowly deteriorating without being maintained.

Below is an image of a massive car park at Swindon, United Kingdom, with thousands upon thousands of unsold cars just sitting there with not a buyer in sight.

The car manufacturers have to buy more and more land just to park their cars as they perpetually roll off the production line.

									The New Canine Influenza, Greyhound Disease, Race Flu, Equine Influenza, Avian Flu

The New Canine Flu, which has killed so many greyhounds, is now in the domestic dog population. There is no treatment and no vaccine. It has jumped species, (by feeding greyhounds raw horse meat, which was infected with horse influenza), (horse influenza is avian flu, which jumped species from birds (avian flu), to horses (horse influenza). The avian flu has now moved to racing greyhounds and domestic dogs and the indications are that there may be a potential problem for humans. It is deadly and it is on the loose. It may just be a matter of time. The CDC is watching the disease.

There is no central tracking agency with report and stat capability for dogs that will get the word out to all vets in the US.


The domestic dog population is at present risk.

This week on my net groups I saw many anecdotal accounts of $100,000 show dogs dying while packed in ice and hooked up to IVs, with high temps. No one knows what is wrong with these dogs and the vets do not know what they are treating. I think it is Greyhound Influenza or Race Flu.

Show populations are now infected and the majority of veterinarians have never heard of the disease. Isolated individuals know this but the country as a whole does not. A few days after exposure at dog shows, dogs are traveling back to their home states and infecting the local populations. Many dogs are dying needlessly. It is not kennel cough.

The period of incubation is 2-5 days. It is airborne, can be transmitted by inanimate objects, and clothing. Virtually all exposed will contract. The morbidity is 80% with 20% being sub clinically affected and shedding the virus. The course of the disease is four weeks. There are two forms, milder and very extreme. Two weeks into the viral disease the dog looks like he is getting over the cough and then bacterial infections become an acute problem. Oft times the owner has reported the dog is well, only to find that a short time later an acute bacterial infection has taken over the dog, in a matter of hours. The owners think the disease has run its course only to learn it hasn't gotten started yet, so dogs are dying needlessly.

My vet thinks earlier rather than later treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics are the best way to treat the disease. With proper vet care perhaps there will only be a mortality of 1-5%.

The information needs to go out so that all vets will know this is not kennel cough, so they will not VAX for kennel cough while ill, and so they can monitor beyond the two week period.

It has been almost impossible for me to understand how in the last four days i have contacted state vets who have never heard of the new influenza, all the while, the people with the info on the disease, refuse to release it nationally.

The AVMA has info that will go out next month. How many will die prior to that? I have begged and cajoled them to do this, so perhaps we are making some headway, however, we need info to go out ASAP.

APHIS says it is not their job.

The people who are handling research on the initial outbreak in FLA., are contacting local, (FLA) BUT not national sources to disseminate information.

Below is a link to a photo album in which i placed the FLA Veterinary Alert and Advisory, which was put out by the FLA VET MED ASSOC., at the request of the State Vet. It is not on the state website.

http://photobucket.com/albums/y249/citycolumbus/

In my conversations with the researchers at the U. of FLA. I was told, by the lead researcher, who owns greyhounds, that they have no responsibility to provide this info to other states or to other vets. (BTW, Is some of the research funded by the gaming organizations?) (My state, GA., the state of FLA., and three highly placed individuals at Pfizer, told me to call the researcher.) The researcher said to me that cultures do not need to be done on potential affecteds, and she denied that the illness is from horses, though she is quoted in articles as applauding the Cornell researcher who identified it as horse influenza. The FLA state vet said: ""We know it came from horses.""

The researcher is working to do a contracted vaccine with "" a company."" She is working on a paper. She did not want to discuss the influenza though her name, email and number appears as the contact source on the state of FLA Veterinary Alert and Advisory that went out to all FLA vets. I was told by some at Pfizer that Pfizer is not the company who is helping her develop the vaccine.

The researcher said the FLA VETERINARY ALERT AND ADVISORY should not be put on the net. However the FLA state Vet, Dr. Thomas Holt, told me, on Fri., Sept 16, 2005 to put it on the net...""Feel free to use it.""

Many state vets who do not know anything at all about this illness even though the state of FLA. put out memos on the influenza in August 05 in the state of FLA., without notifying other states.

If the researchers are correct there will be a national epidemic. When a disease is in a mobile population an epidemic is possible. Large groupings of dogs, such as shows, kennels, rescues, etc., are at risk.

Most vets across the country have never heard of the disease. A treatment protocol has not been developed. They are treating it as if it is kennel cough. All vets need to be informed about it ASAP! Many of us concerned dog people would like to see state statistics compiled on the illness and the eventual treatment outcomes.

Folks, this is one of the many new problems we are seeing from feeding raw meat to dogs. Please do not do it.

									The President signed 923 Executive Orders in 40 Months. It is all over the net. These sites include commentary on what the executive order is for and what it does. If this is the truth, I'm scared to think about it. Most of the past presidents have allegedly signed around 30 of them. At the end of the day an executive order circumvents the congress and senate. Fill in the blanks. Someone credible needs to research and report on this.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.

-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months.

Feel free to verify the ""executive orders"" at will ... and these are just the major ones ...

Teddy Roosevelt: 3
Others Prior To FDR: NONE
FDR: 11 in 16 years
Truman: 5 in 7 years
Ike: 2 in 8 years
JFK: 4 in 3 years
LBJ: 4 in 5 years
Nixon: 1 in 6 years
Ford: 3 in 2 years
Carter: 3 in 4 years
Reagan: 5 in 8 years
Bush 1: 3 in 4 years
Clinton: 15 in 8 years
Bush 2: 62 in 8 years
Obama: 923 in 3+ years!

During my lifetime, all Presidents have issued Executive Orders, for reasons that vary, some more than others.

When a President issued as many as 30 Executive Orders during a term in Office, people thought there was something amiss.

WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT 923 EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN ONE PART OF ONE TERM?????? YES, THERE IS A REASON.

IT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS DETERMINED TO TAKE CONTROL AWAY FROM THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.

Even some Democrats in the House have turned on him, plus a very small number of Democrat Senators question him.

HE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED. WHAT IS HE REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH????

									YOU HAD A HUNCH THE NEWS SYSTEM WAS RIGGED AND YOU COULDN'T PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT, HUH?

THIS MIGHT SOLVE THE PUZZLE:

	ABC News executive producer Ian Cameron is married to Susan Rice, National Security Adviser.
	CBS President David Rhodes is the brother of Ben Rhodes, Obama’s Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications.
	ABC News correspondent Claire Shipman is married to former Whitehouse Press Secretary Jay Carney
	ABC News and Univision reporter Matthew Jaffe is married to Katie Hogan,Obama’s Deputy Press Secretary
	ABC President Ben Sherwood is the brother of Obama’s Special Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood
	CNN President Virginia Moseley is married to former Hillary Clinton’s Deputy Secretary Tom Nides.

And now you know why it is no surprise the media is in Obama's pocket. Think there might be a little bias in the news? This may also explain the cover up of Hillary's private server and emails,

Benghazi, Obamacare's soaring costs, $20 trillion U.S. debt. etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.

Isn't it interesting that every place you look in Obama's administration people fill positions because of who they know, not what they know or how competent they are — and you wonder why our country has so many problems.

Obamacare law requires an RFID chip implanted in all of us.

Are you ready to have your RFID Chip Implanted? 3/23/2013 is your date!

This new Health Care (Obamacare) law requires an RFID chip implanted in all of us. This chip will not only contain your personal information with tracking capability but it will also be linked to your bank account. And get this, Page 1004 of the new law (dictating the timing of this chip), reads, and I quote: ""Not later than 36 months after the date of the enactment"". It is now the law of the land that by March 23rd 2013 we will all be required to have an RFID chip underneath our skin and this chip will be link to our bank accounts as well as have our personal records and tracking capability built into it...""



Seems people will be getting more than they bargained for in this new health care bill.

The Obama health care bill under Sec. 2521, page 1,000 will establish a National Medical Device Registry. What does a National Medical Device Registry mean?

National Medical Device Registry from H.R. 3200 [Healthcare Bill], pages 1,001-1,008:
(g)(1) The Secretary shall establish a national medical device registry (in this subsection referred to as the 'registry') to facilitate analysis of postmarket safety and outcomes data on each device that:

(A) is or has been used in or on a patient;
(B) and is:
    (i) a class III device;

  &nbsp or (ii) a class II device that is implantable, life-supporting, or life-sustaining.
A ""class II device that is implantable?""

Then on page 1,004 it describes what the term ""data"" means in paragraph 1, section B: ""(B) In this paragraph, the term 'data' refers to in formation respecting a device described in paragraph (1), including claims data, patient survey data, standardized analytic files that allow for the pooling and analysis of data from disparate data environments, electronic health records, and any other data deemed appropriate by the Secretary.""

Approved by the FDA, a class II implantable device is a ""implantable radiofrequency transponder system for patient identification and health information.""

This sort of device would be implanted in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option. With the reform of the private insurance companies, who charge outrageous rates, many people will switch their coverage to a more affordable insurance plan. This means the number of people who choose the public option will increase. This also means the number of people chipped will be plentiful as well. The adults who choose to have a chip implanted are the lucky (yes, lucky if you're a Govt Control Libtard) ones in this case. Children who are ""born in the United States who at the time of birth is not otherwise covered under acceptable coverage"" will be qualified and placed into the CHIP or Children's Health Insurance Program (what a convenient name). With a name like CHIP it would seem consistent to have the chip implanted into a child. Children conceived by parents who are already covered under the public option will more than likely be implanted with a chip by the consent of the parent. Eventually everyone will be implanted with a chip. And with the price and coverage of the public option being so competitive with the private companies, the private company may not survive.

A restaurant we eat at now includes the gratuity in the total bill which they say must be paid. The manager said it is now the law that gratuity must be included in the total! Is this true??

									A Country Founded by Geniuses but Run by Idiots

Attributed to Jeff Foxworthy:

If you can get arrested for hunting or fishing without a license, but not for entering and remaining in the country illegally — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If you have to get your parents’ permission to go on a field trip or to take an aspirin in school, but not to get an abortion — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If you MUST show your identification to board an airplane, cash a check, buy liquor, or check out a library book and rent a video, but not to vote for who runs the government — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If the government wants to prevent stable, law-abiding citizens from owning gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds, but gives twenty F-16 fighter jets to the crazy new leaders in Egypt — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If, in the nation’s largest city, you can buy two 16-ounce sodas, but not one 24-ounce soda, because 24-ounces of a sugary drink might make you fat — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If an 80-year-old woman or a three-year-old girl who is confined to a wheelchair can be strip-searched by the TSA at the airport, but a woman in a burka or a hijab is only subject to having her neck and head searched — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If your government believes that the best way to eradicate trillions of dollars of debt is to spend trillions more — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If a seven-year-old boy can be thrown out of school for saying his teacher is ""cute,"" but hosting a sexual exploration or diversity class in
grade school is perfectly acceptable — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If hard work and success are met with higher taxes and more government regulation and intrusion, while not working is rewarded with Food Stamps, WIC checks, Medicaid benefits, subsidized housing, and free cell phones — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If the government’s plan for getting people back to work is to provide incentives for not working, by granting 99 weeks of unemployment checks, without any requirement to prove that gainful employment was diligently sought, but couldn’t be found — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If you pay your mortgage faithfully, denying yourself the newest big-screen TV, while your neighbor buys iPhones, time shares, a wall-sized do-it-all plasma screen TV and new cars, and the government forgives his debt when he defaults on his mortgage — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

If being stripped of your Constitutional right to defend yourself makes you more ""safe"" according to the government — you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.

									WOW! SHE IS WHAT I CALL ""HIGH MAINTENANCE!""

Mary Lincoln was taken to task for purchasing China for the White House during the Civil War.

And Mamie Eisenhower had to shell out the salary for her personal secretary from her husband’s salary.

Total Personal Staff members for other first ladies paid by you the taxpayers:

Mamie Eisenhower:  One — paid for personally out of President's salary.
Jackie Kennedy: One
Rosaline Carter: One
Barbara Bush: One
Hilary Clinton: Three
Laura Bush: One
Michele Obama: Twenty-two

First Lady Requires More Than Twenty Attendants
Recession, Depression, What, Michelle Worry?
July 7, 2009

""In my own life, in my own small way, I have tried to give back to this country that has given me so much,"" she said. ""See, that's why I left a job at a big law firm for a career in public service,"" Michelle Obama.

No, Michele Obama does not get paid to serve as the First Lady and she doesn't perform any official duties. But this hasn't deterred her from hiring an unprecedented number of staffers to cater to her every whim and to satisfy her every request in the midst of the Great Recession. Just think Mary Lincoln was taken to task for purchasing china for the White House during the Civil War. And Mamie Eisenhower had to shell out the salary for her personal secretary.

How things have changed! If you're one of the tens of millions of Americans facing certain destitution, earning less than subsistence wages stocking the shelves at Wal-Mart or serving up McDonald cheeseburgers, prepare to scream and then come to realize that the benefit package for these servants of Miz Michelle are the same as members of the national security and defense departments and the bill for these assorted lackeys is paid by John Q. Public:

1. $172,200 - Sher, Susan (Chief Of Staff)

2. $140,000 - Frye, Jocelyn C. (Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Policy And Projects For The First Lady)

3. $113,000 - Rogers, Desiree G. (Special Assistant to the President and White House Social Secretary)

4. $102,000 - Johnston, Camille Y. (Special Assistant to the President and Director of Communications for the First Lady)

5. Winter, Melissa E. (Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief Of Staff to the First Lady)

6. $90,000 - Medina, David S. (Deputy Chief Of Staff to the First Lady)

7. $84,000 - Lelyveld, Catherine M. (Director and Press Secretary to the First Lady)

8. $75,000 - Starkey, Frances M. (Director of Scheduling and Advance for the First Lady)

9. $70,000 - Sanders, Trooper (Deputy Director of Policy and Projects for the First Lady)

10. $65,000 - Burnough, Erinn J. (Deputy Director and Deputy Social Secretary)

11. $65,000 - Reinstein, Joseph B. (Deputy Director and Deputy Social Secretary)

12. $62,000 - Goodman, Jennifer R. (Deputy Director of Scheduling and Events Coordinator For The First Lady)

13. $60,000 - Fitts, Alan O. (Deputy Director of Advance and Trip Director for the First Lady)

14. Lewis, Dana M. (Special Assistant and Personal Aide to the First Lady)

15. $52,500 - Mustaphi, Semonti M. (Associate Director and Deputy Press Secretary To The First Lady)

16. $50,000 - Jarvis, Kristen E. (Special Assistant for Scheduling and Traveling Aide To The First Lady)

17. $45,000 - Lechtenberg, Tyler A. (Associate Director of Correspondence For The First Lady)

18. $45,000 - Tubman, Samantha (Deputy Associate Director, Social Office)

19. $40,000 - Boswell, Joseph J. (Executive Assistant to the Chief Of Staff to the First Lady)

20. $36,000 - Armbruster, Sally M. (Staff Assistant to the Social Secretary)

21. $36,000 - Bookey, Natalie (Staff Assistant)

22. $36,000 - Jackson, Deilia A. (Deputy Associate Director of Correspondence for the First Lady)

There has never been anyone in the White House at any time that has created such an army of staffers whose sole duties are the facilitation of the First Lady's social life. One wonders why she needs so much help, at taxpayer expense, when even Hillary, only had three; Jackie Kennedy one; Laura Bush one; and prior to Mamie Eisenhower social help came from the President's own pocket.

									Chelsea's Apt. Has Same Address as a Medical Facility!--Hillary's Secret Hospital?
A Presidential candidate collapses at a ceremony in NYC...and is shoved, unconscious, by SS into a van like a side of beef and rushed off...not to one of the many world-class hospitals and clinics nearby...but to her daughter's $11M apartment.

Sound odd? It did to me.

So I looked up a bit about Chelsea's new apt.:
THE WHITMAN, 21 EAST 26TH STREET, 4 - FLATIRON DISTRICT, NEW YORK

I discovered that it exactly shares an address with:

METROCARE HOME SERVICES, INC.
21 East 26th Street, 4th Fl
New York, NY 10010

SAME address..SAME Floor...only One Apt. per floor.

For a woman very secretive about her ambiguous medical conditions...whom avoids hospitals like the plague, it occurred to me that when the Clinton's bought this incredibly expensive apt. for their daughter in 2013...they may have also purchased it with the intent of using it as a secret private medical treatment facility for Hillary to use during her anticipated campaign.

To the press...it would only appear Hillary was just dropping in for a visit with her daughter...when, in reality, she is receiving medical treatment and controlled substances from private physicians and private pharmacists...on private property (no need for disclosure).

If so, Chelsea's apt. served it's secret purpose flawlessly this Sunday.

It makes sense that to establish a clandestine medical treatment facility in a residential apartment--one which is legally compliant with the controlled substances dispensing/stocking/delivery & shipping requirements...and one which is able to legally supply and treat a private patient with the drugs needed, one would also have to register the address as a medical treatment facility.

In this case, I would assume the Clinton Foundation would be the controlling entity.

A staff (and private) doctor or pharmacist would then be employed (Hillary has two) to legally treat the patient, practice medicine within the confines of the private residence...and dispense drugs to that private patient without any disclosure.

This sham medical facility, while legally registered as a public care facility...would also have to be closed to the public in order to operate without any disclosure.

Every year the French have a 4 day celebration in Normandy complete with American uniforms, tanks, jeeps and guns. They still honor the Americans who died there.

In all the years since, Our country has only FOUR TIMES not been there to do the honors.

Four times in 69 years!! I wonder who would have had the lack of respect to not honor our fighting forces?

SHAME ON AMERICA FOR ELECTING A NON-VETERAN PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF: HE IS ABSOLUTELY A DISGRACE TO ALL WHO FOUGHT FOR THIS NATION AND GAVE THEIR LIVES.

June 6, 2013, the 69th anniversary of ""D-Day"", the largest invasion ever attempted, where 200,000 Americans stormed the beaches at Normandy to begin the final push to defeat Nazi Germany in WWII. D-Day marked the turning point in WWII in Europe . Today, European heads of state make it a point to recall and honor the sacrifices of those who landed in Normandy, as do our Presidents....well, most of them....

In the 69 years since D-Day, there are four occasions when the President of the United States chose not to visit the D-Day Monument that honors the soldiers killed during the Invasion.

The occasions were:

1. Barack Obama, 2010
2. Barack Obama, 2011
3. Barack Obama, 2012
4. Barack Obama, 2013

For the past 69 years, every American President except Obama have taken the time to honor the memory and sacrifices of the 6,000 American soldiers killed on D-Day. ...Except Obama!

June 6 2010,
Obama had no events scheduled.

June 6, 2011,
Obama met with the National Security team and was interviewed by WEWS Cleveland and WDIV in Detroit about the auto industry - FAR too busy to visit the D-Day memorial.

June 6, 2012,
instead of honoring our fallen soldiers, Obama made a campaign trip to California on Air Force 1 (at our expense) to raise funds for (his) upcoming election.

June 6, 2013,
Obama was doing ANOTHER fund raiser with the multimillionaires in the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Palo Alto CA, once again at our expense.

									An government anesthesiologist came out and said during the years of 2010-2014, the federal government knowingly injected mothers with a  vaccine mixed in an anesthetic shot known as an Epidural. What was that vaccine? Well according to Henry Rothschild, (no relation to the Rothschild family allegedly) the vaccine is known as Terminar.

Terminar which is Spanish for terminate, according to Mr. Rothschild Terminar was design to break down African American/Black women ovaries exposing them to different germs and multiple diseases which will likely produce a child with serious birth defects and serious illnesses.

For example, she could be indicted for her actions with the Clinton Global Initiative, and she could also be indicted for her email scandal.

2) She is *not* the first woman to be nominated for US President. That honor falls to Victoria Woodhull. She named Frederick Douglass to be her Vice Presidential running mate. Ten other women also have won the nominations of their parties as Presidential candidates.

MEXICO IS ANGRY!

Three cheers for Arizona

The shoe is on the other foot and the Mexicans from the State of Sonora, Mexico doesn't like it. Can you believe the nerve of these people? It's almost funny. The State of Sonora is angry at the influx of Mexicans into Mexico. Nine state legislators from the Mexican State of Sonora traveled to Tucson to complain about Arizona's new employer crackdown on illegals from Mexico.

It seems that many Mexican illegals are returning to their hometowns and the officials in the Sonora state government are ticked off.
 
A delegation of nine state legislators from Sonora was in Tucson on Tuesday to state that Arizona's new Employer Sanctions Law will have a devastating effect on the Mexican state.

At a news conference, the legislators said that Sonora — Arizona's southern neighbor, made up of mostly small towns — cannot handle the demand for housing, jobs and schools that it will face as Mexican workers return to their hometowns from the USA without jobs or money.


The Arizona law, which took effect Jan. 1, punishes Arizona employers who knowingly hire individuals without valid legal documents to work in the United States. Penalties include suspension of, or loss of, their business license.

The Mexican legislators are angry because their own citizens are returning to their hometowns, placing a burden on THEIR state government. 'How can Arizona pass a law like this?' asked Mexican Rep Leticia Amparano-Gamez, who represents Nogales.

'There is not one person living in Sonora who does not have a friend or relative working in Arizona,' she said, speaking in Spanish. 'Mexico is not prepared for this, for the tremendous problems it will face as more and more Mexicans working in Arizona and who were sending money to their families return to their home-towns in Sonora without jobs,' she said. 'We are one family, socially and economically,' she said of the people of Sonora and Arizona.

Wrong!

The United States is a sovereign nation, not a subsidiary of Mexico, and its taxpayers are not responsible for the welfare of Mexico's citizens.

It's time for the Mexican government, and its citizens, to stop feeding parasitically off the United States and to start taking care of its/their own needs.


Too bad that other states within the USA don't pass a law just like that passed by Arizona .

Maybe that's the answer, since our own Congress will do nothing! 																			Collected via Email, May 2008",,01/03/2017,1800,2,"[103854, 109535, 121417, 123786]"

EATING FRUIT
We all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths. It's not as easy as you think. It's important to know how and when to eat.

What is the correct way of eating fruits?

IT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS! * FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

If you eat fruit like that, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities.

FRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD.

Let's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit. The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so.

In the meantime the whole meal rots and ferments and turns to acid. The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil.

So please eat your fruits on an empty stomach or before your meals! You have heard people complaining - every time I eat water-melon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat a banana I feel like running to the toilet etc - actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit on an empty stomach. The fruit mixes with the putrefying other food and
produces gas and hence you will bloat!

Graying hair, balding, nervous outburst, and dark circles under the eyes all these will not happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach.

There is no such thing as some fruits, like orange and lemon are acidic, because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter. If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the Secret of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight.

When you need to drink fruit juice - drink only fresh fruit juice, NOT from the cans. Don't even drink juice that has been heated up. Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. You only get to taste. Cooking destroys all the vitamins.

But eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice. If you should drink the juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it.

You can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse your body. Just eat fruits and drink fruit juice throughout the 3 days and you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look!

KIWI: Tiny but mighty. This is a good source of potassium, magnesium, vitamin E & fiber. Its vitamin C content is twice that of an orange.

APPLE: An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Although an apple has a low vitamin C content, it has antioxidants & flavonoids which enhances the activity of vitamin C thereby helping to lower the risks of colon cancer, heart attack & stroke.

STRAWBERRY: Protective Fruit. Strawberries have the highest total antioxidant power among major fruits & protect the body from cancer-causing, blood vessel-clogging free radicals.

ORANGE: Sweetest medicine. Taking 2-4 oranges a day may help keep colds away, lower cholesterol, prevent & dissolve kidney stones as well as lessens the risk of colon cancer.

WATERMELON: Coolest thirst quencher. Composed of 92% water, it is also packed with a giant dose of glutathione, which helps boost our immune system. They are also a key source of lycopene - the cancer fighting oxidant. Other nutrients found in watermelon are vitamin C & Potassium.

GUAVA & PAPAYA: Top awards for vitamin C. They are the clear winners for their high vitamin C content. Guava is also rich in fiber, which helps prevent constipation. Papaya is rich in carotene; this is good for your
eyes.

Variations:   Versions in circulation in 2010 were titled ""Dr. Oz on Eating Fruit."" There's no good reason to associate the television health pundit's name with the Internet-circulated piece, because Dr. Oz is not the author of the item, nor has he endorsed its claims about ingesting fruit only at specific times.

I recently saw something on twitter claiming the app ""down to lunch"" is really a front for himan trafficking... This seems like an extreme claim, but i have seen multiple reviews on the google play store also claiming this, but none on the apple store...

									Amazing Sight in the Pacific

August 2006, the yacht 'Maiken' is traveling in the south Pacific when they came across a weird sight...

The trail left by the yacht...







And then this was spotted ... ash and steam rising from the ocean ...



And, while they were watching ...



A plume of black ash...

									im really pissed that palindrome isnt palindrome backwards

Ah, yes but emordnilap is a word!

An emornilap is any word that, when spelled backwards, produces another word. Examples of emordnilap pairs include:

desserts & stressed

drawer & reward

gateman & nametag

time & emit

laced & decal

regal & lager

And therefore ""emordnilap palindrome"" is an emordnilap palindrome.

The 13 Constellations of the Zodiac

The Zodiac is the ring of constellations that the Sun seems to pass through each year as the Earth orbits around it. Contrary to popular belief, there are actually 13 zodiacal constellations, if you pay attention to the way astronomers define them. In addition to:

Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries,
Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, and Sagittarius,
the Sun also passes through
Ophiuchus.

Final Nail In Obama's Lack Of US Citizenship Coffin?

AP — WASHINGTON D.C.: In a move certain to fuel the debate over Obama's qualifications for the presidency, the group Americans for Freedom of Information has released copies of President Obama's college transcripts from Occidental College. Released today, the transcript indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate at the school. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship. This document would seem to provide the smoking gun that many of Obama's detractors have been seeking.

The news has created a firestorm at the White House as the release casts increasing doubt about Obama's legitimacy and qualification to serve as president. When reached for comment in London, where he has been in meetings with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Obama smiled but refused comment on the issue. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs scoffed at the report stating that this was obviously another attempt by a right-wing conservative group to discredit the president and undermine the administrations efforts to move the country in a new direction.

Britain's Daily Mail has also carried the story in a front-page article titled, Obama Eligibility Questioned, leading some to speculate that the story may overshadow economic issues on Obama's first official visit to the U.K.

In a related matter, under growing pressure from several groups, Justice Antonin Scalia announced that the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear arguments concerning Obama's legal eligibility to serve as President in a case brought by Leo Donofrio of New Jersey. This lawsuit claims Obama's dual citizenship disqualified him from serving as president. Donofrios case is just one of 18 suits brought by citizens demanding proof of Obama's citizenship or qualification to serve as president.

Gary Kreep of the United States Justice Foundation has released the results of their investigation of Obama's campaign spending. This study estimates that Obama has spent upwards of $950,000 in campaign funds in the past year with eleven law firms in 12 states for legal resources to block disclosure of any of his personal records. Mr. Kreep indicated that the investigation is still ongoing but that the final report will be provided to the U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder. Mr. Holder has refused to comment on the matter.																			Collected via e-mail, April 2009",,14/08/2016,3151,0,"[104003, 104004, 113420, 113957, 118532]"

									HOW TO STOP ISLAMIC TERRORISTS . . . it worked once in our History . . .

Once in US history an episode of Islamic terrorism was very quickly stopped. It happened in the Philippines about 1911, when Gen. John J. Pershing was in command of the garrison. There had been numerous Islamic terrorist attacks, so ""Black Jack"" told his boys to catch the perps and teach them a lesson.

Forced to dig their own graves, the terrorists were all tied to posts, execution style. The US soldiers then brought in pigs and slaughtered them, rubbing their bullets in the blood and fat. Thus, the terrorists were terrorized; they saw that they would be contaminated with hogs' blood. This would mean that they could not enter Heaven, even if they died as terrorist martyrs.

All but one was shot, their bodies dumped into the grave, and the hog guts dumped atop the bodies. The lone survivor was allowed to escape back to the terrorist camp and tell his brethren what happened to the others. This brought a stop to terrorism in the Philippines for the next 50 years.

Pointing a gun into the face of Islamic terrorists won't make them flinch. They welcome the chance to die for Allah. Like Gen. Pershing, we must show them that they won't get to Muslim heaven (which they believe has an endless supply of virgins) but instead will die with the hated pigs of the
devil.



Subject: How to end the war quickly if you have absolutely no respect for pigs!

An Israeli friend recently informed me that the UK fought the Islamic terrorist attacks by burying the criminals with a pig. Apparently the Islamic belief is that if ones' body is buried with a pig (because they are considered unclean) their soul will go to hell. I did a little research into this subject matter and found it to be true. This got me thinking.

If we put a baby pig on every airline flight then all suicide terrorists would abort their missions as they would not want their souls to go to hell. Additionally, if we drop shipped, oh say, 100,000 pigs into Afghanistan I think our recon and assault efforts may be more successful. Apparently Muslims dislike the very sight of pigs A LOT!

They are also adamantly opposed to alcohol, thus we spike their water supply with a few thousand gallons of moonshine, get them drunk and turn the pigs loose. The war would be over in a weekend.

									Does this photo taken in the Oval Office convey anything to you about attitude and arrogance?

Would you speak with the Chief of Staff, your Chief Economics Adviser, and your Senior Adviser with your feet up on the Resolute Desk — a gift from Queen Victoria to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880?

We should inundate the White House with emails demanding that he stop desecrating his office and keep his feet off of our furniture.

This arrogant, immature, self-centered idiot demonstrates repeatedly that he has no sense of honor, or of simple decency.

While this posture is disrespectful in any culture, it is absolutely never done in any executive setting.

Further, in over half of the cultures of the world, it is recognized not only as disrespectful, but as an extreme insult to show the bottom of your shoes. In some cultures it could also get you killed!

He thinks of himself as a king — and not as a servant of the people, humbly occupying our White House for his term in office.

Electing him was an enormous mistake — and will cost us in many ways, for generations

									I saw this on a FB post of one of my friends. It does no sound right. Could you find out. Thank you in advance.

This needs passing around far and wide and will affect anyone in the UK who doesn't have a biometric passport (also known as an e-passport) if flying to the USA.

I was supposed to be on a flight this morning travelling to Florida for a holiday with my family booked through Thomson's, we saved long and hard for this holiday and filled in all the neccessary online forms including API and ESTA's only a couple of weeks ago only to turn up at the check in desk to be advised that I would not be allowed to travel as I did not have a biometric passport whilst the rest of our family had them, despite calls to the USA from the lady on check in they would not permit travel.

This is a change that came into force from USA Homeland Security on the 1st April 2016 which nobody including Thomson's seemed to be aware of until they were confronted with it on the day it came into force. Yet a month on Thomson's are still not advising people who have booked with them of the change and on calling their ''Customer Services'' if you can call it that they are just placing the onus back on the passenger citing ''it is the travellers responsibility to check everything is valid for travel''

Do a Google search, it isn't mentioned on the Gov website, it isn't mentioned on Thomson's website either.

My passport was in date and had more than 6 months on it and I had filled out the ESTA's which were all approved.

We were then advised that if we still wished to travel on another date that we would have to pay an extra £150 each to transfer the booking. with no alternative I advised the rest of our party to go without me and I would try and see what I could do and look to meet up with them at the earliest available date which looks like being Wednesday next week from a different airport.

I have now spent best part of 3 hours on the phone being passed from pillar to post and had to fork out over £500 to try and get to the US on Wednesday to meet up with a very distraught family to try and rescue a totally ruined holiday.

Has anyone else suffered the same issue? What if any legal redress do we have?

So just to be clear, if you are travelling to the USA you won't be allowed to travel if you have a non biometric passport. The Biometric Passport has a camera logo on the front cover in the centre at the bottom of the page for those who may be unaware of the difference and were introduced gradually from 2006 onwards

I am telling the world and his dog to raise awareness as it is clear that Thomson don't give two monkeys about customer care.																			Collected via e-mail, May 2016",,21/02/2019,3786,1,"[112955, 116657, 120033, 128025, 128026]"

Israel has just banned Heinz Ketchup, despite the strong political pull the company has with all world Governments, seeing that the heiress of the company, Theresa Heinz Kerry, is the wife of current U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

It turns out, there at least has to be a certain amount of actual tomatoes in the actual ketchup to actually be considered ketchup, and Heinz falls WAY short in this regard.

But don’t worry, good eater, as there are plenty of other “things” in what has turned out to be a gooey, red mystery sauce. The problem is, and as Israel’s Government, at least, has addressed in order to protect their people, these “things” don’t necessarily even belong in the human body.

									I've just seen a post on Facebook that immediately seemed untrue, and has already been shared by a lot of friends. This is the post...

Just now, according to info received from a traffic police friend, there are already six car owners made police reports, if there is someone holding a name card and knock at your car window asking for direction. Please do not open your car window, as there is a cutter placed under the name card which is used for slashing victim's face and rob. Please be extra careful! Kindly convey this message! Please also send to those who are not driving too, for the sake of their friends who are driving!

There was no location mentioned and a lot of bad grammar and spelling. There was also a photo used which looks like legit at 1st glance but there are other injuries on the guys neck that don't add up. Was hoping you could clear this one up for me as you are usually the first place I go to try and stop stupid posts from being shared!

									What do you know about the attached picture supposedly showing a sanders rally last week with 27,000 people in attendance? His campaign and especially his so called supporters are so disingenuous about everything that I am now skeptical of everything they say, everything they post on the internet, etc. I do see one person in the photo with what appears to be a campaign sign, but it could be photoshopped. I see no other signs in the photo or indication that the photo is of a rally, or a concert, or...?

						See Example(s)

						
							
								
									A sobbing little girl stood near a small church from which she had been turned away because it 'was too crowded'. ""I can't go to Sunday School,"" she sobbed to the pastor as he walked by. Seeing her shabby, unkempt appearance, the pastor guessed the reason and, taking her by the hand, took her inside and found a place for her in the Sunday School class. The child was so touched that she went to bed that night thinking of the children who have no place to worship Jesus.

Some two years later, this child lay dead in one of the poor tenement buildings and the parents called for the kindhearted pastor, who had befriended their daughter, to handle the final arrangements. As her poor little body was being moved, a worn and crumpled purse was found which seemed to have been rummaged from some trash dump. Inside was found 57 cents and a note scribble in childish handwriting which read, ""This is to help build the little church bigger so more children can go to Sunday school.""

For two years she had saved for this offering of love. When the pastor tearfully read that note, he knew instantly what he would do.

Carrying this note and the cracked, red pocketbook to the pulpit, he told the story of her unselfish love and devotion. He challenged his deacons to get busy and raise enough money for the larger building. But the story does not end there!

A newspaper learned of the story and published it. It was read by a Realtor who offered them a parcel of land worth many thousands. When told that the church could not pay so much, he offered it for a 57 cent payment.

Church members made large subscriptions. Checks came from far and wide. Within five years the little girl's gift had increased to $250,000.00 — a huge sum for that time (near the turn of the century). Her unselfish love had paid large dividends.

When you are in the city of Philadelphia, look up Temple Baptist Church, with a seating capacity of 3,300, and Temple University, where hundreds of students are trained. Have a look, too, at the Good Samaritan Hospital and at a Sunday School building which houses hundreds of Sunday scholars, so that no child in the area will ever need to be left outside at Sunday school time.

In one of the rooms of this building may be seen the picture of the sweet face of the little girl whose 57 cents, so sacrificially saved, made such remarkable history. Alongside of it is a portrait of her kind pastor, Dr. Russell H. Conwell, author of the book, Acres of  Diamonds — a true story.

									Washington, DC – President Barack Obama and the Democrat controlled Congress is considering sweeping legislation that will provide
new benefits for many Americans. The Americans With No Abilities Act. AWNAA is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the
millions of Americans who lack any real skills or ambition.

‘Roughly 50 percent of Americans do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society,’ said
California Senator Barbara Boxer. ‘We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability to be ridiculed and passed over. With this
legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they have some idea of what they
are doing.’

In a Capitol Hill press conference, House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pointed to the success of the U.S.
Postal Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. Approximately 74 percent of postal
employees lack any job skills, making this agency the single largest U.S employer of Persons of Inability.

Private-sector industries with good records of non-discrimination against the Inept include retail sales (72%), the airline industry (68%), and home
improvement ‘warehouse’ stores (65%). At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has an excellent record of hiring
Persons of Inability (63%).

Under The Americans With No Abilities Act, more than 25 million ‘middle man’ positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little
real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance.

Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given so as to guarantee upward mobility for even the most unremarkable employees. The
legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability into middle-management
positions, and gives a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires.

Finally, the AWNAA contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the non-abled, banning, for example,
discriminatory interview questions such as, ‘Do you have any skills or experience that relate to this job?’

‘As a Non-abled person, I can’t be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them,’ said Mary Lou Gertz, who lost her position
as a lug-nut twister at the GM plant in Flint , Michigan, due to her inability to remember ‘rightey tightey, lefty loosey.’ ‘This new law should be real good for people like me,’ Gertz added.

With the passage of this bill, Gertz and millions of other untalented citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.

Said Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL): ‘As a Senator with no abilities, I believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy ought to be
extended to every American with no abilities. It is our duty as lawmakers to provide each and every American citizen, regardless of his or her
inadequacy, with some sort of space to take up in this great nation and a good salary for doing so.



The Australians With No Abilities Act (AWNAA)

CANBERRA, Australia: - The new Labor Government is not wasting any time with its Industrial Relations Policy. Already, it is considering sweeping legislation which will provide new benefits for over ¾ of a million Australians. The Australians With No Abilities Act (AWNAA) is being hailed as a major legislative goal by advocates of the millions of Australians who lack any real skills or ambition.

""Roughly 50 percent of Australians do not possess the competence and drive necessary to carve out a meaningful role for themselves in society,"" said New Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. ""We can no longer stand by and allow People of Inability to be ridiculed and passed over. With this legislation, employers will no longer be able to grant special favors to a small group of workers, simply because they hey have some idea of what they are doing.""

In a Parliamentary press conference, Deputy Prime Minister Julia Guillard pointed to the success of the Australian Public Service, which has a long-standing policy of providing opportunity without regard to performance. Approximately 84 percent of it's employees lack any job skills, making
this agency the single largest Australian employer of Persons of Inability.

Private-sector industries with good records of nondiscrimination against the Inept include retail sales (72%), the airline industry (68%), and home improvement ""warehouse"" stores (65%). At the state government level, the Department of Motor Vehicles also has a great record of hiring Persons of
Inability (63%).

Under the Australians With No Abilities Act, more than ¼ of a million ""middle man"" positions will be created, with important-sounding titles but little real responsibility, thus providing an illusory sense of purpose and performance.

Mandatory non-performance-based raises and promotions will be given, to guarantee upward mobility for even the most unremarkable employees. The legislation provides substantial tax breaks to corporations that promote a significant number of Persons of Inability into middle-management positions, and gives a tax credit to small and medium-sized businesses that agree to hire one clueless worker for every two talented hires.

Finally, the AWNA Act contains tough new measures to make it more difficult to discriminate against the Non-abled, banning, for example, discriminatory interview questions such as ""Do you have any skills or experience which relate to this job?""

""As a Non-abled person, I can't be expected to keep up with people who have something going for them,"" said Mary Gertzog, who lost her position as a wheel-nut installer at the GM plant in Elizabeth, South Australia, due to her lack of any discernible job skills. ""This new law should really help people like me."" With the passage of this bill, Gertzog and hundreds of thousands of other untalented citizens will finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.

Said Martin Ferguson: ""As a Politician With No Abilities, I believe the same privileges that elected officials enjoy, ought to be extended to every Australian with no abilities.

									Make sure the grocery buyer in your household reads this.

There should be more leading Australians like Dick, he gets to the bottom of important issues and anything that amounts to selling out Australia is very important.

A WARNING FROM DICK SMITH: You may be aware that "" Dick Smith "" chain franchise stores are being pressured by the Islamic Council of Australia to gain 'Halal Certification' otherwise they will be proscribed and banned from Muslim custom.

This is their response:

""We have received a number of letters from people asking if we will be putting the Muslim Halal logo on our food.
 
To acquire Halal certification, payment is required to the endorsing body and involves a number of site inspections of both our growers and processors in order to ensure that our practices comply with the conditions of Halal certification. It is important to note that this does not reflect the quality of the food being processed or sold – it only means that the products are approved as being prepared in accordance with the traditions of the Muslim faith.
 
We are aware of an increasing number of large companies both in Australia and overseas, such as Kraft and Cadbury, who have obtained accreditation to use the Halal logo. We don’t believe they have done this because of any religious commitment but rather for purely commercial reasons. Perhaps these large organisations can afford to do this. While we have a choice however, we would prefer to avoid unnecessarily increasing the cost of our products in order to pay for Halal accreditation when this money would be better spent continuing to support important charitable causes where assistance is greatly needed.

We point out that we have never been asked to put a Christian symbol (or any other religious symbol) on our food requiring that we send money to a Christian organization for the right to do so.

Others would add that money paid to ANY Muslim 'organization' (and you had better believe it: these people ARE 'organized') can easily find its way into the hands of Islamic extremist-fanatics and murderers, irrespective of assurances to the contrary.

What other assurances do we accept from Muslims?

Oh, that's right, 'Islam is a religion of PEACE'!

How less Australian can companies get, than to place money into the hands of those who seek to exploit us?""

This is an example of how the leaders of Muslims in Australia/NewZealand are bullying large commercial organizations (especially in the food industry) into paying what is no more than blatant extortion money. The amazing part is that these weak-kneed organizations (Cadbury/ Schweppes/ Nestles/ Kraft etc.) actually pay the large sums demanded by these self-appointed religious bureaucrats.

Of course, the manufacturers promptly pass this levy on to unwitting consumers as cost increases. Next time you buy a block of Cadbury's chocolate, look for the Halal Certification seal on the wrapper. So, regardless of your own religious faith, you end up subsidizing Islam.
The Council also controls the Muslim voter bloc which, as yet, does not have sufficient critical mass to make a difference - but give them time.

Several state jurisdictions are under pressure to adopt or permit Sharia Law in Marriage, Family and Property matters and some, under the delusion that they are being progressively liberal, are permitting this. This has already happened in some local authorities in the U.K. Google the U.K. Education Department's current investigation into the conduct of Muslim-run schools in the Birmingham area of England.

How many more warnings do people need?

									Doug Stephener, a cannibal pedophile sentenced to death in Texas asked for his last meal this weekend ... a little boy.

The man, who will be executed by lethal injection next week, filled out his application indicating that he wished to enjoy a child aged 8 years or less. He also said he refused to be served a child of Asian origin.

The Prison Service is obligated to accept all requests, whatever they are. Thus, it could be that they will be buying a corpse from a morgue to satisfy the desires of Doug Stephener.

Doug Stephener was sentenced to death in 2008 for rape and cannibalism of children in his neighborhood.


 
Stephen K. Walker, French M. Robertson Unit inmate in Abilene, Texas, is on death row for murder and cannibalism of the 2006 case that sentenced him to death.

When asked what he would want his final meal to be, he said with no hesitation, ""A little boy.""

The Department of Corrections are supposed to accept all the demands of any kind. So it was initially thought that they were buying a corpse in a morgue to satisfy the desires of Stephen Walker.

But tables turned when it was said that they were trying to find a toddler from a third world country and buy him/her alive within a budget of $25,000.

State representative Michael Rath talked to the media briefly with words that he thought would clear the situation some:

""We live in a country where we have laws in place and morals, and we will look to grant Mr. Walker his request under certain circumstances that we have yet to agree to."" He stated.

As far as the 'circumstances,' it is rumored that the child would have to suffer from some type of degenerative disease, with a few years to live. And by honoring Walkers request it saves the child from years of suffering.

We will see how this plays out. Walker will be executed next Saturday.																			Collected via e-mail, September 2014",,23/10/2016,5478,0,"[110543, 118670]"

									32 Girls Have Died

11,916 adverse events already reported to the CDC ... and counting.

Pain and swelling. Life-threatening muscle weakness. Blood clots in the heart and lungs.

And the deaths of 32 innocent girls and young women.

You might think I'm talking about a deadly new disease or a global epidemic ...

I'm not.

Sadly, it's more sinister than that. The health threats listed above have all been linked with Gardasil, the so-called ""cervical cancer vaccine."" And thanks to Pharma giant Merck, desperate parents and naive young women believe this vaccine saves lives... they couldn't be more wrong.

That's why HSI's Jenny Thompson has released a new video in which she exposes the deception for what it is — and reveals some truly shocking information no one else is talking about.

And you are the very first to see it.

Please, if you have daughters, granddaughters or friends who might be considering this terrible vaccine, you must watch this video. And please forward it to anyone you think would benefit from the vital information it contains.

If you think you know the whole story on Gardasil, I think you'll be shocked by what you're about to see. Just click here to start watching the video.

									Today the web is buzzing about the supposed discovery of caves supposedly created by the Knights Templar 700 years ago.
The locale is known as the Caynton Caves, and is well known locally in England where is lies, and has been since at least the 19th century. The story about it being a Knights Templar site, however, appears to be rather new.
Remarkably enough for what would be an archaelogical find of major importance -- if true -- there is nothing whatsoever that I can find in Google Books or Google Scholar on the Caynton Caves and their supposed connection to the Knights Templar.
What I can find is this: that the caves were the work of an eccentric British gentleman back in the days of Queen Victoria.

Caves & tunnels found under Shropshire Field.
Possibly used by followers of the Knights Templar

									Hillary’s VP Tim Kaine: Whites Must Become a “Minority” to Atone For Racism

In little noticed comments, Hillary’s running mate Tim Kaine told a black audience in New Orleans that white people must become a “minority” in order to properly atone for racism and oppression suffered by blacks.

“I’ve never been treated badly in life because of my skin color or my gender,” Kaine told a group of black Baptists in New Orleans. “I think the burden is on those of us who are in the majority — Caucasians. We have to put ourselves in a place where we are the minority.”

The “burden” that Kaine mentions obviously means taking on “white guilt,” despite the fact that – even at the height of slavery – only 1.4% of whites in America owned slaves. White people were also victims of far more brutal and longer lasting oppression under the Barbary slave trade.

									Is the post about students pointing out ""immigrants"" who will be sent ""home"" when Trump becomes president based in fact? It is posted on Shaun King's public Facebook age: https://www.facebook.com/shaunking/ with the comment: America. 2016. The mainstreaming of bigotry trickling down to children. It is supposedly a repost from Evelyn Momplaisir, but her public page does not show the post. Can you verify this happened?

_____________________________________________________________________________

There's a Twitter screengrab making the rounds. You've probably seen it - a Fairfax county mother named Evelyn Momplaisir who was shocked because her son is encountering racist remarks from school bullies. To wit: once President, Trump will kick your family out of the country.

I hate to be put in the position of devil's advocate on this, but preliminary searches are unearthing a few suspicious details. And let's face it - even with the best of intentions, we have ALL been fooled by online stories before.

Can anyone actually validate this?

Twitter shows that Evelyn Momplaisir doesn't have an account. (True, it could have been deleted or made private for some reason.)

There's been no legitimate news coverage on this that I can find. Seems to me this is the kind of a story that the ""liberal media"" would KILL themselves to ferret out.

There is an Evelyn Momplaisir on Facebook. She is black and has a school-age son. But her occupation is a Fairfax County Public Schools TEACHER. In addition, Momplaisir received some nationwide attention 6 years ago when the Today show ran some sort of fluff piece on her wedding. (I have no idea how that would tie in here - it's just an unusual side note.)

You guys know me. I have nothing good to say about any part of Donald Trump. But I pride myself on fairness - I'm not going to take this potshot if it's not warranted. Lord knows there's enough legitimate stuff to say about the man without resorting to untrue viral crap.

I hope I'm wrong. And at the same time, I hope I'm not.

									The Justice Gazette reporters and others are conducting an investigation into voting irregularities and the theft of Bernie Sanders's apparent California landslide victory by those supporting Hillary Clinton. According to popular actress Frances Fisher, a lawsuit is being prepared to require the counting of all the provisional ballots. If this lawsuit is successful, the actual vote count is expected to become known and Sanders will likely have a landslide victory in California.



Virtually all MSM sources are claiming CA is 100% reported, this IS NOT true. The LA County Registrar alone, released this statement 10 minutes ago: ""First estimate of ballots remaining to be processed: ~240,063 provisional; 125,280 VMB returned at polls; 204,946 VBM recorded via mail.""

San Diego County's website states, ""there are APPROXIMATELY 285000 Mail / Provisional ballots still to be counted,"" and San Bernardino County has 95,000 more outstanding.

In other words, there are 570,000 ballots to be counted in LA County, 285,000 in San Diego County, 95,000 in San Bernardino County (that's a total of 950,000 in just three counties), and who knows how many more need to be counted in California's 55 other counties (58 total).

At this point it's very likely we won't even see the provisional/VMB ballot breakdown this week, or even the next.

									So I was reading this article and I know there is a lot of transphobic stuff going around but this seemed a little ridiculous. The article states that the VA GOP is pushing to get a ""anatomically correct sex"" bathroom use. Basically they want to pass a bill that requires children to have their genitals checked before using a bathroom. Sounds a little far fetched.

									I have heard that people are claiming Melania Trump's speech writer, Meredith McIver does not exist as she does not have a verified Twitter page or Linked in profile.

What's worse? That Meredith McIver might not exist or that it took his campaign roughly 36 hours to come up with this strategy? Both?— Eireann Dolan (@EireannDolan) July 20, 2016


Facebook post this morning indicates that possibly Trump speechwriter McIver is actually not a living person, but a bogus persona created by the Trump organization to release a fake ""apology"" letter. 

So there's a chance that McIver, the staffer who apparently took the blame, doesn't even exist. Like the PR guy that Trump pretended to be.— Steve C (@djchubakka) July 21, 2016

									Pastor Jeremiah Steepek (pictured below) transformed himself into a homeless person and went to the 10,000 member church that he was to be introduced as the head pastor at that morning. He walked around his soon to be church for 30 minutes while it was filling with people for service....only 3 people out of the 7-10,000 people said hello to him. He asked people for change to buy food... NO ONE in the church gave him change. He went into the sanctuary to sit down in the front of the church and was asked by the ushers if he would please sit in the back. He greeted people to be greeted back with stares and dirty looks, with people looking down on him and judging him.

As he sat in the back of the church, he listened to the church announcements and such. When all that was done, the elders went up and were excited to introduce the new pastor of the church to the congregation....""We would like to introduce to you Pastor Jeremiah Steepek""... The congregation looked around clapping with joy and anticipation.....The homeless man sitting in the back stood up... and started walking down the aisle... the clapping stopped with ALL eyes on him.... he walked up the altar and took the microphone from the elders (who were in on this) and paused for a moment.... then he recited

""Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.' Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?'

""The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'""

After he recited this, he looked towards the congregation and told them all what he had experienced that morning... many began to cry and many heads were bowed in shame... he then said... Today I see a gathering of people... not a church of Jesus Christ. The world has enough people, but not enough disciples... when will YOU decide to become disciples? He then dismissed service until next week... Being a Christian is more than something you claim. It's something you live by and share with others.

									WEDDING RING BEING REPAIRED, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WATCH

In a press conference last week Obama was not wearing his wedding ring nor was he wearing his watch. When noticed, his staff said his ring was out for repairs.

No reason was given for the missing watch.

So it's just a coincidence that Muslims are forbidden from wearing jewelry during the month of Ramadan??? (think about that one)

Can't possibly be that, because although he hasn't gone to a Christian church service since entering the White House, we know he's a committed Christian 'cause he said so during the campaign.

And how convenient to be ""on vacation"" in Hawaii over Christmas so he doesn't have to have the Christmas photograph of him and his family attending Christmas services with a Bible in his hand — his ringless and watchless hand.

2ND PEARL HARBOR?????

What is wrong with this picture?

The picture is of the five ""first line"" US nuclear carriers docked together in one place. Just like Battleship Row, Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941.

This picture was taken the other day in Norfolk, Virginia. The Obama Administration ordered 5 nuclear carriers into harbor for ""routine"" (?) inspections. Heads of the Navy were flabbergasted by the directive but had to comply as it was a direct order from their Commander of Deceit.

The carriers were all pulled out from the MIDDLE EAST and the Afghanistan support role leaving our land forces naked and exposed!

NORFOLK, VA. (February 8, 2013). This is the first time since WWII that five [5] nuclear powered aircraft carriers were docked together:

USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77), USS Enterprise (CVN 65), USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), and USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) are all in port at Naval Station Norfolk, Va., the world's largest naval station.

Knowledgeable Sources stated that this breached a long standing military protocol in the Navy meant to avoid a massive enemy strike on major US forces. Obama is ‘Commander in chief’. This ordering of most of the Navy's capitol ships into one place is unprecedented since Pearl Harbor! This could be the creation of a false flag atomic incident too stupid for any enemy to pass up.

Did the Clinton campaign force Bernie Sanders' endorsement? Is he still in the race somehow? This rumor sounds fake to me, but it keeps showing up on comment threads:

""I have contacts within both campaigns. Here’s what I was told yesterday and today. Clinton’s campaign “threatened” to vote down every concession made to Bernie on the platform if he did not endorse her prior to the convention. Knowing that Superdelegates were not going to switch to his side without something major happening, the best he could do was hold on to the progressive concessions he won for US on the platform. He could not, in good consciousness let the GOP and Trump win, especially when we have a potential half of the Supreme Court Justices that will be replaced within the next 4-8 years. He was looking out for the future of our movement and our nation in this very hard decision he made. This post is not to tell you to vote for Hillary, or to not leave the Democratic Party, etc. this was just to throw a little light on why Bernie did what he felt he HAD to do, rather than what he wanted to do. A sign of a great leader is someone who makes the hard decision to sacrifice themselves for the people and movement behind him. He is counting on us to continue the fight.""

									I am passing this along...there are comments from two other people I have also been asked if we keep guns in the house. The nurse just kinda slipped it in along with all the other regular questions. I told her I refused to answer because it was against the law to ask. Everyone, whether you have guns or not, should give a neutral answer so they have no idea who does and who doesn't.

My doctor asked me if I had guns in my house and also if any were loaded. I , of course, answered yes to both questions. Then he asked why I kept a loaded gun close to my bed. I answered that my son, who is a certified gun instructor and also works for Homeland Security, advised me that an unloaded, locked up gun is no protection against criminal attack. The Government now requires these questions be asked of people on Medicare, and probably everyone else.

Just passing this along for your information: I had to visit a doctor other than my regular doctor when my doctor was on vacation. One of the questions on the form I had to fill out was: Do you have any guns in your house?? My answer was None of your damn business!! So it is out there!

It is either an insurance issue or government intervention. Either way, it is out there and the second the government gets into your medical records (As they want to under Obamacare) it will become a major issue and will ultimately result in lock and load!!

Please pass this on to all the other retired guys and gun owners...Thanks.



From a Vietnam Vet and retired Police Officer:

I had a doctors appointment at the local VA clinic yesterday and found out something very interesting that I would like to pass along.

While going through triage before seeing the doctor, I was asked at the end of the exam, three questions:

1. Did I feel stressed? 
2. Did I feel threatened?  
3. Did I feel like doing harm to someone?

The nurse then informed me, that if I had answered yes to any of the questions, I would have lost my concealed carry permit as it would have gone into my medical records and the VA would have reported it to Homeland Security.

Looks like they are going after the vets first. Other gun people like retired law enforcement will probably be next. Then when they go after the civilians, what argument will they have?

Be forewarned and be aware. The Obama administration has gone on record as considering veterans and gun owners potential terrorists. Whether you are a gun owner veteran or not, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !

If you know veterans and gun owners, please pass this on to them. Be very cautious about what you say and to whom.

									A large number of UPS uniforms have gone missing.

Please inform all properties to check ID's and be alert to ""replacement"" delivery personnel.

Please forward accordingly



SECURITY ALERT: $32,000 worth of UPS uniforms have been purchased over the last 30 days by person(s) unknown. Law enforcement is working on the case however no suspect(s) have been indentified. Subjects may try to gain access by wearing one of these uniforms. If anyone has suspicions about a UPS delivery (i.e., no truck but driver, no UPS identification, etc., contact UPS to verify employment).

If you see or have seen a UPS delivery from an unknown driver please ask for proper ID and be alert to any suspicious packages or deliveries. Please notify building security or appropriate law enforcement.



There has been a huge purchase, $32,000.00 worth, of United Parcel Service (UPS) uniforms on eBay over the last (30) thirty days. This could represent a serious threat as bogus drivers can drop off anything to anyone with deadly consequences.

If you have any questions when a UPS driver appears at your door, they should be able to furnish valid I.D. Additionally, if someone in a UPS uniform comes to make a drop off or pick up, make absolutely sure they are driving a UPS truck. UPS does not make deliveries or pick ups in anything except company vehicles. If you have a problem, immediately call local law enforcement.

On 3/31/03 an alert was issued to UPS drivers. Drivers were asked to keep track of their uniforms and to dispose of same according to UPS guidelines.

Some of you may have already heard the above information, but I will keep sending out new alerts as I get them.																			Collected via e-mail, 2003",,10/09/2016,7972,0,"[120607, 134020, 134021]"

									Among the many racists posting videos and news articles on my newsfeed regarding the Syrian refugees, I came across this video of some Syrian refugees complaining that their hotel room has no television, the food is terrible and that they want to go back to Syria. The people are speaking perfect English, but something about the video rings false to me.



Hello, I keep seeing online 'news' articles talking about Syrian refugees complaining about the quality of free food given to them by host nations such as Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands and was wondering if there is any credence to these rumors? I can't find any unbiased source unfortunately, so I can't tell for myself how factual it is.



There is a video making its round on Facebook. It claims to be a video of Syrian refugees in the Netherlands complaining about their living conditions and that this is no real life that they would like to go back home even though there is war. I would just like to know if this video is real. I can't seem to figure out how to submit the video but I have the link and you can also find it at breitbart.com  Thank you for your time & hope that you are able to get to the truth or authenticate the video.

									Allah or Jesus?

Last month I attended my annual training session that's required for maintaining my state prison security clearance. During the training session there was a presentation by three speakers who represented the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim faiths who explained their belief systems. I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say.

The Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam complete with a video. After the presentations time was provided for questions and answers. When it was my turn I directed my question to the Imam and asked: ""Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that all of the Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the world. And, that by killing an infidel, which is a command to all Muslims, they are assured of a place in heaven. If that's the case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?""

There was no disagreement with my statements and without hesitation he replied, ""Non-believers!""

I responded, ""So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can go to heaven. Is that correct?""

The expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of a little boy who had just gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He sheepishly replied, ""Yes.""

I then said, ""Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Pat Robertson or Dr. Stanley ordering Protestants to do the same in order to go to heaven.""

The Imam was speechless.

I continued, ""I also have problem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me. Let me ask you a question . . . would you rather have your Allah who tell[s] you to kill me in order to go to heaven or my Jesus who tells me to love you because I am going to heaven and wants you to be with me?""

You could have heard a pin drop as the Imam hung his head in shame.

Chuck Colson once told me something that has sustained me these 20 years of prison ministry. He said to me, ""Rick, remember that the truth will prevail.""

									(AL-MANAR Television - Beirut Lebanon) With the announcement of the attacks at the World Trade Center in New York, the international media, particularly the Israeli one, hurried to take advantage of the incident and started mourning 4,000 Israelis who work at the two towers. Then suddenly, no one ever mentioned anything about those Israelis and later it became clear that they remarkably did not show up in their jobs the day the incident took place.

No one talked about any Israeli being killed or wounded in the attacks. Arab diplomatic sources revealed to the Jordanian al-Watan newspaper that those Israelis remained absent that day based on hints from the Israeli General Security apparatus, the Shabak, the fact which evoked unannounced suspicions on American officials who wanted to know how the Israeli government learned about the incident before it occurred, and the reasons why it refrained from informing the U.S authorities of the information it had.

Suspicions had increased further after Israeli newspaper Yadiot Ahranot revealed that the Shabak prevented Israeli premier Ariel Sharon from traveling to New York and particularly to the city's eastern coast to participate in a festival organized by the Zionist organizations in support of the ""Israel"". Aharon Bernie, the commentator at the newspaper, brought up the issue and came up with a negative conclusion, saying ""no answer"". He then asked about the clue behind the Shabak's position in preventing Sharon's participation, and again without giving an answer.

Bernie added that Sharon, who was delighted for having his speech on top of the festival agenda, asked the head of the organization to mediate and convince the Shabak to change its position, but his attempts were in vain. The next day after Sharon's secretary officially announced that Sharon would not participate the incident took place.

For its part, the Israeli Ha'aretz newspaper revealed that the FBI arrested five Israelis four hours after the attack on the Twin Towers while filming the smoking skyline from the roof of their company's building. The FBI had arrested the five for ""puzzling behavior"". They are said to have been caught videotaping the disaster in what was interpreted as cries of joy and mockery.



It has been confirmed by the US Goverment and FBI that at the time of the accident, there were 4000 Jews who MIRACULOUSLY never came to their work an the World trade Center building at the time of the accident. This means the Jews knew and were prewarned about the accident that the WTC was going to be hit.... WHY ??????

In every crime you look at who has most to benefit from the act. In this case this crime has been a disaster for America, for the world and also for Arabs and Musilms. The only people who benefited from this act of terror are the Jews. This is not the first time Israel and the Jews have done something like this in the name of someone else to further their own selfish needs. They have even resorted to kiling their own people to win public sympathy and support. This act is not beyond the capabilities and evil deeds of Israel. In this case it seems that it is clear to all that the Jews/Israel have most to gain and should be considered as a possible source behind this act.

I hope the FBI follows the smoking gun as no one will commit an act unless he has something to gain from it, Israel should be a prime suspect in this case.																			Collected via e-mail, September 2001",,06/11/2017,8933,0,"[113101, 113331]"

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Venezuela holds an inflation rate of 720%, after surpasing world records at 250% last year. 9.1% is projected for Uruguay – the 4th highest inflation rate in Latin America.

Venezuela’s debt with Uruguay – which directly affects dairy farmers as much of the volume of sales to that country constitute as cheese and milk powder – is a fortune.

It is estimated that the Caribean country owes  aproximately $ 100 million to the dairy sector. Conaprole (the largest company in the industry in Uruguay) alone still awaits U$S86 million in goods already delivered and consumed across the continent.

									THIS MAKES MY BLOOD BOIL!!! I AM SO MAD! 

What does this word mean? Dhimmitude

The word ""Dhimmitude"" is found in the new health care bill. So what does it mean? Obama used it in the health care bill . Now isn't this interesting? It is also included in the health care law.

Dhimmitude. I had never heard the word until now, so I typed it into Google and started reading. Pretty interesting! It's on Page 107 of the Obama healthcare bill. I looked this up on Google and, yep, it exists.....it is a REAL word.

Dhimmitude is the Muslim system of controlling non-Muslin populations conquered through jihad (Holy War). Specifically, it is the TAXING of non-Muslims in exchange for tolerating their presenceAND as a coercive means of converting conquered remnants to Islam!

ObamaCare allows the establishment of Dhimmitude and Sharia Muslim diktat in the United States!

Muslims are specifically exempted from the government mandate to purchase insurance and also from the penalty tax for being uninsured! Islam considers insurance to be ""gambling,"" ""risk-taking,"" and ""usury"" and is thus banned. Muslims are specifically granted exemption based on this.

How convenient. So I, as a Christian, will have crippling IRS liens placed against all of my assets and will face hard prison time because I refuse to buy insurance or pay the penalty tax. Meanwhile, Louis Farrakhan will have no such penalty and will have 100% of his health insurance needs paid for by the de-facto government insurance. 

Non-Muslims will be paying a tax to subsidize Muslims. This is Dhimmitude.

American citizens need to know about it...... Every non-Muslim in the United States of America needs to know about it. 



ObamaCare discriminates against Christians and Jews by denying them special exemptions extended to other religions.

If you are a mainstream Christian or a Jew, you need not apply to Opt Out of ObamaCare; that exemption is reserved for Muslims, Scientologists, Amish, Christian Scientists and Native American Indians who have a ""conscientious objection"" to insurance. A conscientious objection to theft committed by rouge politicians under the color of law with the threat of violence for non-compliance isn’t sufficient in America today to exempt average Americans from the stranglehold of government. Believe it or not, if you are a Muslim you may claim a special religious exemption to Obama-Care that is denied to main-stream Christians and Jews. Or if you prefer a New-Age religion to Islam, you may become a Scientologist and Opt Out of ObamaCare’s mandatory purchase of health insurance. Or, if you happen to be of Native American Indian extraction you too can opt out of the insurance laws by which everyone else in America must abide.

SOMEONE YOU CALL YOUR FRIEND, WANTS YOU DEAD.

Someone you call your friend wants you dead by all means, and the person have spent a lot of money on this, the person also came to us and told us that he wants you dead and he provided us your names, photograph and other necessary information we needed about you. If you are in doubt with this I will send you your name and where you are residing in my next mail.

Meanwhile, I have sent my boys to track you down and they have carried out the necessary investigation needed for the operation, but I ordered them to stop for a while and not to strike immediately because I just felt something good and sympathetic about you. I decided to contact you first and know why somebody will want you dead by all means. Right now my men are monitoring you, their eyes are on you, and even the place you think is safer for you to hide might not be.

Now do you want to LIVE OR DIE? It is up to you. Get back to me now if you are ready to enter deal with me, I mean life trade, who knows, and I might just spear your life, $8,000 is all you need to spend. You will first of all pay $3,000 then I will send the tape of the person that want you dead to you and when the tape gets to you, you will pay the remaining $5,000. If you are not ready for my help, then I will have no choice but to carry on the assignment after all I have already being paid before now.

Warning: do not think of contacting the police or even tell anyone because I will extend it to any member of your family since you are aware that somebody want you dead, and the person knows some members of your family as well.

For your own good I will advise you not to go out once is 7pm until I make out time to see you and give you the tape of my discussion with the person who want you dead then you can use it to take any legal action.

									MUST READ!!!!! I'm Done Wearing ""Levi Jeans"". This was just brought to my attention, Back in slavery days they would ""Beat"" and ""Kill"" the strongest Black Man On The Plantation. They would do so in front of his family and every other slaves on the plantation. After He'd been beaten, they would tie two ""ROPES"" one to each of his ""LEGS"" and those ropes were tied to ""TWO HORSES"" they would then proceed to beat the horses making them run in opposite directions. Eventually the horses would rip his legs from his body...... The Logo on ""Levi Jeans"" shows how this process went. You see the two ""Slave"" owners whipping the horses and the ropes visibly connected from the horses to the mans legs. It's supposed to be amusing and to show how hard it would be to actually tear a pair of these jeans that's why the words ""Quality Clothing"" appears over both of the horses. Smh I've been wearing these jeans for years, WELL NOT ANYMORE!

CHOLESTEROL: Two tablespoons of honey and three teaspoons of cinnamon powder mixed in 16 ounces of tea water, given to a cholesterol
patient, was found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10% within 2 hours. As mentioned for arthritic patients, if taken 3 times a day, any chronic cholesterol is cured. As per information received in the said journal, pure honey taken with food daily relieves complaints of cholesterol.

COLDS: Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon lukewarm honey with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon powder daily for 3 days. This process will cure most chronic cough, cold and clear the sinuses.

An Arab terrorist named Atta blew up a bus in Israel in 1986. The Israelis captured, tried and imprisoned him. As part of the Oslo agreement Israel had to agree to release so called ""political prisoners"". However, Israeli officials insisted that they would not release any with ""blood on their hands"". Some well meaning American President and Secretary of State insisted that all be released.

Thus Mr. Atta was freed and eventually thanked the US by flying an airplane into Tower One of the World Trade Center. This was reported by many of the networks at the time the terrorists were first identified. It was missing from later reports. That President and Secretary of State were Ronald Reagan and George Schultz.

As part of the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians in 1993, Israel had to agree to release so-called ""political prisoners."" However, the Israelis would not release any with ""blood on their hands.""

The American President at the time, Bill Clinton, and his Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, ""insisted"" that all prisoners be released. Thus Mr. Atta was freed and eventually ""Thanked the US"" by flying an airplane into Tower One of the World Trade Center.

So glad you folks added a charge for using overhead compartments. Finally, the vast majority of us who don't travel with luggage are free from subsidizing that burdensome few who do.



Your decision to create a class of service that does not include use of overhead bins is reprehensible. I see that estimates are that you will see a billion dollars of extra revenue from passengers who have to pay to check luggage who must choose higher fares to include luggage or pay a checked luggage fee when they might have been able to carry on their luggage. I doubt very seriously that your budget economy seats will be sold at the low fares one sees from the low cost European airlines where one expects fees for anything beyond the fare. And even those airlines don't charge for use of overhead bins for goodness sakes. As a former status holder on United and every other major US airline, you've long held my prize for worst customer focus and service.

									Earlier this week, this story about a marine veteran supposedly being beaten and robbed by fiver teens is starting to circulate. The first time I noticed this story was as a posted link to USMCLife.com, and it was only that site and a connected blog to it where you could even hear of such a story. Nonetheless it was picked up by the echo chamber with not as much as a verification to the credibility of this story.

____________________________________________________________________________________

This story's been reported on a bunch of sites, it says Chris Marquez, a military veteran, was assaulted by a group of teens after they asked him if ""Black lives matter?"" According to the articles it took place at the China Town McDonalds in DC, but there's no evidence other than the victim's word. I'm surprised that McDonalds doesn't have a camera considering its location, or that nothing was caught on the street, and I feel a little skeptical.

The dialogue reported here sounds improbable to me. Would love to have this incident investigated:

									Hi, this is something I've been reading about a lot lately on Reddit and it's really starting to annoy the crap out of me:

Have you heard about the ""pizzagate"" conspiracy theory?

It seems to be the easiest way to get pretty caught up is through this Reddit post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/pizzagate/comments/5da0kp/comet_ping_pong_pizzagate_summary/

Now, there is obviously some weird stuff in there, but I really think these people are starting to go crazy!! One of the supposedly inappropriate pictures they pull from James Alefantis' instagram is of a smiling girl with her hands taped down to a table. Yeah that's weird but, can that not just be a really innocent game? Like just picking on a little kid?

I have many questions like that about most of the evidence they have. They have even stated the name ""James Alefantis"" is similar to the french saying for ""I love children,"" they say that Comet Pizza's menu contains a pedophile symbol (it's a set of ping pong paddles?!?), they say there are obvious pedophilic references in instagram posts made by Alefantis of literal pizza memes. Am I the only person who thinks pizza is just pizza? It's like people who love bacon are obsessed with bacon. This guy owns a pizza place, the act of stuffing your face with pizza is like a trendy meme right now, he's the owner of a pizza place, why wouldn't he post pics of pizza?

Please check out this company, and see if it is legitimate. I would like to order a TV Frog, but not sure this is a scam. I called the US phone number, but I got an automatic message to email the company, but the email is different from the one on the site.



Does the TV Frog advertised to replace Cable/Satelite really work?



I have been trying to add a file to the submission message for a few days to no avail.
the file is a PDF of the add posted on the net.
The company is supposed to be Dutch and has a modem that you can connect to your cable and it by passes the fees charged to get paid programs????
it is called TVFrog.

						See Example(s)

						
							
								
									An investigation has revealed the identity of the man whose Social Security number (SSN) has been illegally used by Obama: Jean Paul Ludwig, who was born in France in 1890, emigrated to the United States in 1924, and was assigned SSN 042-68-4425 in or about March, 1977. Ludwig lived most of his adult life in Connecticut. His SSN begins with the digits 042, which are among those reserved for Connecticut residents. Obama never lived or worked in that state, so there is no reason for his SSN to start with the digits 042.

Now comes the best part. Ludwig spent the final months of his life in Hawaii, where he died. Conveniently, Obama's grandmother, Madelyn Payne Dunham, worked part-time in the Probate Office in the Honolulu Hawaii Courthouse, and therefore had access to the SSNs of deceased individuals. The Social Security Administration was never informed of Ludwig's death, and because he never received Social Security benefits there were no benefits to stop and no questions were raised. The suspicion, of course, is that Dunham, knowing her grandson was not a  U.S. citizen — either because he was born in  Kenya or became a citizen of  Indonesia upon his adoption by Lolo Soetoro — merely scoured the probate records until she found someone who died who was not receiving Social Security benefits, and ""selected"" that SSN for Obama.

Sandra Day O'Connor, first woman on the US Supreme Court and a Republican appointee, really sticks it to the obstructionists:

""'...that President Barack Obama should get to name the replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia.' I have a serious problem with that language. It is patronizing, and sounds like caving in to a child. ""He gets to go to the circus."" Barack Obama does NOT ""get to"" appoint the next Supreme Court justice. He is entitled to and responsible for that appointment, per the Constitution of the United States of America. This is NOT a concession he needs to win. The rightwing narrative around this is absolutely false and anti-Constitutional. The radical Republicans are a vile, petulant, hateful, passel of obstructionists whose only unifying goal is their loathing of a black president who became their target the day he was elected by the American people to lead them.""

Being reported: Trump Accidentally Fires Off ‘Boring Mike Pence’ Tweet During VP Speech Before He Can Stop Himself. “Boring Mike Pence lacks any charisma or charm,” Trump’s tweet about his running mate read in part, adding that the Tea Party–aligned conservative was a “total disaster” and “very hard to watch.” “Doing a lousy job. Knows nothing about winning. Pathetic.” True or not?

									With all that is going in Washington these days some things don’t make the news the way they should.  Fourteen days ago President Obama issued an Executive Order that you should know about.  This order gives an unprecedented level of authority to the President and the federal government to take over all the fundamental parts of our economy - in the name of national security - in times of national emergency. This means all of our water resources, construction services and materials (steel, concrete, etc.), our civil transportation system, food and health resources, our energy supplies including oil and natural gas — even farm equipment — can be taken over by the President and his cabinet secretaries. The Government can also draft U.S. citizens into the military and force U.S. citizens to fulfill ""labor requirements"" for the purposes of ""national defense."" There is not even any Congressional oversight, only briefings are required.

By issuing this as an Executive Order the President puts the federal government above the law, which, in a democracy, is never supposed to happen.

As President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, he has the Constitutional authority to issue executive orders.  And while similar orders have been made before by presidents from Eisenhower and Reagan to Clinton and George Bush - it has never been done to this extent.

It is still unclear why this order was signed now, and what the consequences are for our nation - especially during times of peace.  This type of Martial Law imposes a government takeover on U.S. citizens that is typically reserved for national emergencies, not in a time of relative peace.

									Anti-Gun Senator Shoots Intruder

Long time Anti-Gun Advocate State Senator R.C. Soles, 74, shot one of two intruders at his home just outside Tabor City, N.C. about 5 p.m. Sunday, the prosecutor for the politician's home county said.

The intruder, Kyle Blackburn, was taken to a South Carolina hospital, but the injuries were not reported to be life-threatening, according to Rex Gore, district attorney for Columbus, Bladen andBrunswick counties.

The State Bureau of Investigation and Columbus County Sheriff's Department are investigating the shooting, Gore said. Soles, who was not arrested, declined to discuss the incident Sunday evening.

""I am not in a position to talk to you,"" Soles said by telephone. ""I'm right in the middle of an investigation.""

The Senator, who has made a career of being against gun ownership for the general public, didn't hesitate to defend himself with his own gun when he believed he was in immediate danger and he was the victim.

In typical hypocritical liberal fashion, the ""Do as i say and not as I do"" Anti-Gun Activist Lawmaker picked up his gun and took action in what apparently was a self-defense shooting. Why hypocritical you may ask? It is because his long legislative record shows that the actions that he took to protect his family, his own response to a dangerous life threatening situation, are actions that he feels ordinary citizens should not have if they were faced with an identical situation.

It has prompted some to ask if the Senator believes his life and personal safety is more valuable than yours or mine.

						See Example(s)

						
							
								
									There was a time in my life twenty years ago when I was driving a cab for a living. It was a cowboy's life, a gamblers life, a life for someone who wanted no boss, constant movement, and the thrill of a dice roll every time a new passenger got into the cab.

What I didn't count on when I took the job was that it was also a ministry. Because I drove the night shift, the car became a rolling confessional. Passengers would climb in, sit behind me in total darkness and anonymity, and tell me of their lives. 

We were like strangers on a train, the passengers and I, hurtling through the night, revealing intimacies we would never have dreamed of sharing during the brighter light of day.

In those hours, I encountered people whose lives amazed me, ennobled me, made me laugh, and made me weep.  And none of those lives touched me more than that of a woman I picked up late on a warm August night. I was responding to a call from a small brick fourplex in a quiet part of town. I assumed I was being sent to pick up some partyers, or someone who had just had a fight with a lover or someone going off to an early shift at some factory in the industrial part of town.

When I arrived at the address, the building was dark except for a single light in a ground-floor window. Under these circumstances many drivers would just honk once or twice, wait a short minute, and then drive away. Too many bad possibilities awaited a driver who went up to a darkened building at two-thirty in the morning.

But I had seen too many people trapped in a live of poverty who depended on the cab as their only means of transportation. Unless a situation smelled of danger, I always went to the door to try to find the passenger. It might, I reasoned, be someone who needed my assistance. Would I not want a driver to do the same if my mother or father had called for a cab? 

So I walked to the door and knocked.

""Just a minute"", answered a frail and elderly voice. I could hear something being dragged across the floor. 

After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman, somewhere in her eighties, stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like you might see in a costume shop or a Goodwill store or in a 1940s movie. By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The sound had been her dragging it across the floor.

The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets. There were no clocks on the walls, no knickknacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware.

""Would you carry my bag out to the car?"" she said. ""I'd like a few moments alone. Then, if you could come back and help me? I'm not very strong.""

I took the suitcase to the cab, then returned to assist the woman. She took my arm, and we walked slowly toward the curb. She kept thanking me for my kindness. 

""It's nothing"", I told her. ""I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated"". 

""Oh, you're such a good boy"", she said. Her praise and appreciation were almost embarrassing.

When we got in the cab, she gave me an address, and then asked, ""Could you drive through downtown?""

""It's not the shortest way,"" I answered. 

""Oh, I don't mind,"" she said. ""I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice"".

I looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. 

""I don't have any family left,"" she continued. ""The doctor said I should go there. He says I don't have very long."" 

I quietly reached over and shut off the meter. ""What route would you like me to go?"" I asked.

For the next two hours we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator. We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they had first been married. She made me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl. Sometimes she would have me slow down in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.

As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, ""I'm tired. Let's go now.""

We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a tar driveway that passed under a portico. Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. Without waiting for me, they opened the door and began assisting the woman. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her: perhaps she had phone them right before we left.

I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase up to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair. 

""How much do I owe you?"" she asked, reaching into her purse. 

""Nothing,"" I said.

""You have to make a living,"" she answered. 

""There are other passengers,"" I responded. 

Almost without thinking, I bent over and gave her a hug. She held onto me tightly. ""You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,"" she said. ""Thank you."" 

There was nothing more to say. I squeezed her hand once, then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me I could hear the door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life.

I did not pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly, lost in thought. For the remainder of that day, I could hardly talk. What if that woman had gotten a driver who had been angry or abusive or impatient to end his shift? What if I had refused to take the run or had honked once, then driven away? What if I had been in a foul mood and had refused to engage the woman in conversation? How many other moments like that had I missed or failed to grasp?

We are so conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments. But great moments often catch us unawares. When that woman hugged me and said that I had brought her a moment of joy, it was possible to believe  that I had been placed on earth for the sole purpose of providing her with that last ride. I do not think that I have done anything in my life that was any more important. 																			Collected via e-mail, January 2012",,27/03/2016,11959,0,"[109381, 109382]"

									I was told today that cavities in teeth are contagious person to person. Meaning my husband can get cavities from me having them. Is this true?!?!



New research reveals that dental caries, also known as cavities or tooth decay, is actually an infectious disease ... The bacteria most responsible for tooth decay are Steptococcus mutans and Steptococcus sobrinus. These bacteria are passed easily from person to person.

Research is finding that this bacteria is passed easily from adults to children when kissing, sharing utensils or any other activity that transmits saliva. Streptococcus mutans is not passed to each other as adults, so children, especially ages 6 to 36 months of age, are particularly susceptible.

People who are claiming to be in-the-know says that this is a trick/prank, like charging your phone by putting it in the microwave or waterproofing it. This trick, they say, will ""brick"" your iPhone temporarily (until you perform an operation that resets it).

									OK, mosquitos . . . prepare to be repelled!!!!!

Use Bounce Fabric Softener Sheets . . . Best thing ever used in Louisiana . . . just wipe on & go. . . Great for Babies

Bob, a fisherman, takes one vitamin B-1 tablet a day April through October . He said it works. He was right. Hasn't had a mosquito bite in 33 years. Try it. Every one he has talked into trying it works on them. Vitimin B-1 (Thiamine Hydrochloride 100 mg.)

If you eat bananas, the mosquitos like you — something about the banana oil as your body processes it. Stop eating bananas for the summer and the mosquitos will be much less interested.

This is going to floor you, but one of the best insect repellents someone found (who is in the woods every day), is Vick's Vaporub.

Plant marigolds around the yard, the flowers give off a smell that bugs do not like, so plant some in that garden also to help ward off bugs without using insecticides.

""Tough guy"" Marines who spend a great deal of time ""camping out"" say that the very best mosquito repellant you can use is Avon Skin-So-Soft bath oil mixed about half and half with alcohol.

One of the best natural insect repellants that I've discovered is made from the clear real vanilla. This is the pure vanilla that is sold in Mexico. It works great for mosquitoes and ticks, don't know about other insects.

INCREDIBLE. I DIDN'T KNOW TOM HANKS DAD WAS THE LEAD SINGER OF THE DIAMONDS WAY BACK IN 1957! THEY SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME AS THEY DID!

2 Performances 47 years apart
FYI, the lead singer of the Diamonds is also the father of TOM HANKS.

If you were alive in 1957, and old enough to enjoy Rock and Roll, you will probably remember the group, ""The Diamonds"" who had just launched their super hit ""Little Darlin'"". For you that are too young to remember - it was a time when the performers were happy, enjoying themselves, respecting their fans, dressed appropriately and their lyrics could be understood. They did not feel obligated to scream, eat the microphone, mumble inaudible lyrics or trash the set.

In 1957, The Diamonds had a hit with ""Little Darlin"". 47 years later, they were requested to perform at Atlantic City ... This link leads to both performances.

Watch the first one then scroll down for the new one 47 years later.

									During the hostage crisis in Iran in the 70's, did Jimmy Carter ban Iranians from entering our country? And how was this temporary ban any different than Trumps suggestion that we halt immigration until things are figured out?

____________________________________________________________________________________

There is a meme going around Facebook right now. I am trying to research it but can't find the full text of the executive orders cited. From what I have been able to find, however (summaries and so forth), it seems like this meme is true. Here is the meme, and my question after it:

How many are aware that President Carter banned Iranians from coming to the US, with the exception of those with a major medical emergency or threat of political persecution? Additionally, between November 1979 and April 1980, 14,768 Iranians (2,204 were students) were removed from the Country. It all happened under executive orders #12172 and 12206.

Since it seems that there is precedent for what Trump is proposing, is it valid that people are upset with him, or are they/we just forgetting history?																			Collected via e-mail and Reddit, December 2015",,19/06/2016,12520,1,"[123806, 125632, 125922, 127615]"

									Wondering if this letter is real:

Oxford Fights Back.............

One of the interesting emails of this year....

This letter is a response from Oxford to Black Students attending as Rhodes Scholars campaigning to remove the statue of Oxford Benefactor, Cecil Rhodes.
Dear Scrotty Students,

Cecil Rhodes’s generous bequest has contributed greatly to the comfort and well being of many generations of Oxford students – a good many of them, dare we say it, better, brighter and more deserving than you.

This does not necessarily mean we approve of everything Rhodes did in his lifetime – but then we don’t have to. Cecil Rhodes died over a century ago. Autres temps, autres moeurs. If you don’t understand what this means – and it would not remotely surprise us if that were the case – then we really think you should ask yourself the question: “Why am I at Oxford?”

Oxford, let us remind you, is the world’s second oldest extant university. Scholars have been studying here since at least the 11th century. We’ve played a major part in the invention of Western civilisation, from the 12th century intellectual renaissance through the Enlightenment and beyond. Our alumni include William of Ockham, Roger Bacon, William Tyndale, John Donne, Sir Walter Raleigh, Erasmus, Sir Christopher Wren, William Penn, Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), Samuel Johnson, Robert Hooke, William Morris, Oscar Wilde, Emily Davison, Cardinal Newman, Julie Cocks. We’re a big deal. And most of the people privileged to come and study here are conscious of what a big deal we are. Oxford is their alma mater – their dear mother – and they respect and revere her accordingly.

And what were your ancestors doing in that period? Living in mud huts, mainly. Sure we’ll concede you the short lived Southern African civilisation of Great Zimbabwe. But let’s be brutally honest here. The contribution of the Bantu tribes to modern civilisation has been as near as damn it to zilch.

									Remember this?

I was at a UNC lecture the other day where they played a video of Oliver North during the Iran-Contra deals during the Reagan administration. I was only 14 back then but was surprised by this particular clip. There was Olie in front of God and Country getting the third degree. But what he said stunned me. He was being drilled by some senator I didn't recognize who asked him:

'Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?'

Oliver replied, 'Yes I did sir.'

The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, 'Isn't this just a little excessive?'

'No sir,' continued Oliver.

'No. And why not?'

'Because the life of my family and I were threatened.'

'Threatened? By who.'

'By a terrorist, sir.'

'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?'

'His name is Osama bin Laden.'

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

'Why are you so afraid of this man?'

'Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.'

'And what do you recommend we do about him?'

'If it were me I would recommend an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.'

The senator disagreed with this approach and that was all they showed of the clip.

It's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of Osama bin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guess like all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread like the virus they truly are.

									No longer did the free flowing liquor in speakeasies carry its former names of White Lightning, Tanglefoot, and Firewater; alcohol now carried the new monikers of cocktail, devil’s candy, bathtub gin, booze, and hooch. Where beer and wine had previously been the drinks of choice, now alcohol was drank much more frequently, as it was easier to transport and took up less space, making it cheaper for speakeasy patrons. It was at this time that the ""cocktail” was born, which had virtually been non-existent prior to Prohibition. In the days of the "" Old West,” most men drank either beer or straight shots of liquor. However, during this new era that welcomed women, alcohol began to be mixed with soft drinks, sugar-water and fruit juices. Making the bootlegged liquor much more palatable, millions of people who didn't like the taste of beer, wine, or hard liquors found cocktails irresistible, turning men and women alike, into ""criminals” by the thousands. While often having their cocktails in teacups in case of a raid, old social barriers were broken, as the rich and powerful began to rub shoulders with ordinary folks. From housewives, to large business owners, blue collar workers, corrupted police chiefs and mayors, these many patrons befriended each other in their quest of the same goals – drinking and avoiding the law.

									Supposedly this ""secret"" was ""revealed"" by a Target employee:



Every Target shopper needs to know this; If the price ends in 8, it will be marked down again. If it ends in a 4, it's the lowest it will be. 

Target's mark down schedule: 

MONDAY: Kids' Clothing, Stationery (office supplies, gift wrap), Electronics.   
TUESDAY: Women's Clothing and Domestics. 
WEDNESDAY: Men's Clothing, Toys, Health and Beauty.
THURSDAY: Lingerie, Shoes, Housewares. 
FRIDAY: cosmetics. 



If you're like me, you probably love shopping at Costco, hoping to find a great deal on everything from TV's to bulk diapers.  But shopping at the big box megastore can be a bit overwhelming.  Did you know there is actually a ""Costco Price Tag Code"" that can let you know if you're getting the best deals?

The key to the code is not the dollars but the cents.  Those last two digits of the price tell you everything.  A price ending in .99 is much different than one ending in .97 or .49.  Check it out ...

Price ending in .99 – the product is full price

Any time you see the price ending in .99 you know that item is full-priced and has not been marked down. It still may be a good deal though, this is Costco after all.

Price ending in .97 – a deal decided by the manager

A price that ends in .97 is what we are looking for. Usually this is a special price you're not going to find again. Once it's gone it's gone. These can be some great deals.

Price ending in .49 or .79 – manufacturer's special

A price ending in .49 or .79 is a manufacturer's special. This is a product the manufacturer is testing out at Costco, usually at a lower price than Costco would sell the item at.

Price ending in .00 — the goods are about to go!

A price ending in .00 is probably the best deal you will find in the store. It means the manager wants the item out. And once it's out, the product is gone for good.

A price tag with an asterisk — it's discounted and done

Be on the lookout for price tags with an asterisk. This means the product is discontinued. A combination of a .97 and an asterisk means you are getting a last chance good deal.

We all know Costco has the lowest prices in town but now you can use these tricks to get deeper discounts inside the warehouse.  Share this with anyone you know who shops

									RED FLAG - CONSUMER ALERT:
Are you buying food that has been grown by using oil wastewater?
I recently picked up this bag of mandarin oranges at the grocery store and today I learned that this particular brand is being grown using toxic wastewater, from Chevron oil. I plan on returning them and explaining why consuming food that has grown using oil toxins is bad for living things and destroys living soil. This is shady business!

Currently, these food growers receive oil industry wastewater:

-Sunview (table grapes, raisins, persimmons, and prune plums)
-Wonderful Citrus (Halos and Cuties – this company also owns Fiji Water, -POM Wonderful, and the world's largest pistachio and almond growing operation)
-Trinchero Family Estates (wine)
-Bee Sweet Citrus (mandarins, oranges, and lemons)

The mandarin oranges called Halos are being grown in toxic water from Chevron oil.

are ""cuties"" tangerines grown with ""fracked"" water?

									Bill Clinton's loving wife ... by Dick Morris, former political adviser to President Bill Clinton.

If you happen to see the Bill Clinton 5-minute TV ad for Hillary in which he introduces the commercial by saying he wants to share some things we may not know about Hillary's background, beware. As I was there for most of their presidency and know them better than just about anyone, I offer a few corrections.

Bill says: ""In law school, Hillary worked on legal services for the poor."" 

The facts are: Hillary's main extra-curricular activity in law school was helping the Black Panthers, on trial in Connecticut for torturing and killing a federal agent. She went to court every day as part of a law student monitoring committee trying to spot civil rights violations and develop grounds for appeal.

Bill says: ""Hillary spent a year after graduation working on a children's rights project for poor kids."" 

The facts are: Hillary interned with Bob Truehaft, the head of the California Communist Party. She met Bob when he represented the Panthers and traveled all the way to San Francisco to take an internship with him.

Bill says: ""Hillary could have written her own job ticket, but she turned down all the lucrative job offers."" 

The facts are: She flunked the DC bar exam; yes, flunked. It is a matter of record, and only passed the Arkansas bar. She had no job offers in Arkansas — none — and only got hired by the University of Arkansas Law School at Fayetteville because Bill was already teaching there. She did not join the prestigious Rose Law Firm until Bill became Arkansas Attorney General and was made a partner only after he was elected Arkansas
Governor.

Bill says: ""President Carter appointed Hillary to the Legal Services Board of Directors and she became its chairman."" 

The facts are: The appointment was in exchange for Bill's support for Carter in his 1980 primary against Ted Kennedy. Hillary then became chairman in a coup in which she won a majority away from Carter's choice to be chairman.

Bill says: ""She served on the board of the Arkansas Children's Hospital."" 

The facts are: Yes, she did. But her main board activity, not mentioned by Bill, was to sit on the Walmart board of directors for a substantial fee. She was silent about their labor and health care practices.

Bill says: ""Hillary didn't succeed at getting health care for all Americans in 1994, but she kept working at it and helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) that provides five million children with health insurance.""

The facts are: Hillary had nothing to do with creating CHIP. It was included in the budget deal between Clinton and Republican Majority Leader Senator Trent Lott. I know; I helped negotiate the deal. The money came half from the budget deal and half from the Attorney Generals' tobacco settlement. Hillary had nothing to do with either source of funds.

Bill says: ""Hillary was the face of America all over the world.""

The facts are: Her visits were part of a program to get her out of town so that Bill would not appear weak by feeding stories that Hillary was running the White House. Her visits abroad were entirely touristic and symbolic and there was no substantive diplomacy on any of them.

Bill says: ""Hillary was an excellent Senator who kept fighting for children's and women's issues.""

The facts are: Other than totally meaningless legislation like changing the names on courthouses and post offices, she has passed only four substantive pieces of legislation. One set up a national park in Puerto Rico. A second provided respite care for family members helping their relatives through Alzheimer's or other conditions. And two were routine bills to aid 911 victims and responders which were sponsored by the entire NY delegation. Presently she is trying to have the US memorialize the Woodstock fiasco of 40 years ago.

Here is what bothers me more than anything else about Hillary Clinton:

She has done everything possible to weaken the President and our country
(that's you and me!) when it comes to the war on terror.

1.   She wants to close GITMO and move the combatants to the USA where they would have access to our legal system.

2.   She wants to eliminate the monitoring of suspected Al Qaeda phone calls to/from the USA.

3.   She wants to grant constitutional rights to enemy combatants captured on the battlefield.

4.   She wants to eliminate the monitoring of money transfers between suspected Al Qaeda cells and supporters in the USA.

5.   She wants to eliminate the type of interrogation tactics used by the military & CIA where coercion might be used when questioning known terrorists even though such tactics might save American lives.

One cannot think of a single bill Hillary has introduced or a single comment she has made that would tend to strengthen our country in the War on Terror. But, one can think of a lot of comments she has made that weaken our country and make it a more dangerous situation for all of us. Bottom line: She goes hand in hand with the ACLU on far too many issues where common sense is abandoned.

Share this with every democrat you know. Ask them to prove Dick Morris wrong. Think about it — Dick Morris has said all of this openly, thus if he were not truthful he'd be liable for defamation of character! And you better believe Hillary would sue him.

12547,"A list of coincidences connecting the number 108 to the Chicago Cubs world series victory in 2016 is accurate.

				
					

						See Example(s)

						
							
								
									There are 108 stitches in a baseball, designed by the Cubs first manager and ace pitcher A.G. Spalding, whose Chicago office was originally located at 108 W. Madison Street.

• The left and right field corners at Wrigley Field — are 108 meters from home plate.

• The Ricketts family, which owns the Cubs, has located their main business — TD Ameritrade — on 108th street in Omaha, Nebraska.

• The number 108 is a sacred number in yoga. and Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta does yoga 6 days a week.

• Cubs win the World Series in the 1990 J.J. Abrams film “Taking Care of Business,” which is 108 minutes long.

• Cubs win the World Series in the 1989 film “Back To The Future Part II,” which is 108 minutes long.

• On 10/8 in 1945 Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis, who placed a curse on the Cubs for not letting his goat enter Wrigley Field, sent Cubs owner P.K. Wrigley a telegram stating, “Who smells now?” after a Cubs loss.

• Wrigley Field was built on land that once housed a church and a seminary, and 108 is considered a holy number in many religions.

• The Emil Verban Society is named after a three-season player with the Cubs, whose batting average in his last season in 1950 with the team was only .108.

“Hey, the last time the Cubs won a World Series game was 10/8 in 1945,” chirped DePorter, who also reminded Sneed that the distance between the Sun and Earth is 108 times the diameter for the Sun, and the distance between the moon and Earth is 108 times the diameter of the moon . . . yikes!

Sneed’s favorite: Cubs manager Joe Maddon’s mantra for the World Series favorite Cubbies is “Try not to suck.”

“And, if you didn’t know this already, Hindu mantras are traditionally repeated 108 times,” said DePorter, who has also selected pop band “The Plain White T’s”— who have recorded 108 songs — to play at Harry Caray’s eatery at the Cubs early morning rally on Oct. 4 with Cubs Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg.

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT!!!!!!!

For the love of anything holy...... PLEASE stop using this crap in your hair!

I had a client wanting to do a light blonde ombré..... I can do this in my sleep! (And on my occasions, I have,lol) the application was finished and it was time to sit a process....... After only ten mins.

She came up to me telling me her hair is burning..... I felt the foils and... Damn, nearly burned my fingers!!!!!! I opened the packet and smoke comes billowing out.......

Mind you I have done this clients color for several years with no issue ever.......I asked the usual questions i.e. Well water, medication etc. the only thing that was there she used Pantene shampoo and conditioner........
This crap had plastic and silicones in it and when it comes in contact with a bleach or hi-lift color it reacts and the bleach will melt off the build up and becomes a very hot liquid and if it come in contact with skin it will cause a burn.

I had two other clients in the past 7 years that this crap called Pantene was the key factor in a serious situation.

If you are using it and plan to get color done, please throw it away and have your stylist do a detox to get rid of the deposits.

There is a difference between cheap and salon quality. Do not let anyone lie to you and try to say anything more........

Ones casualities start coming in due to your blatant disregard and obvious knowing of those Muslim extremists buying those burner phones, we the people will blame you. There was more than enough reasonable suspicion to arrest those foreigners on a probable threat of terrorism. THey are not US citizens, they don't need due process like AMericans. You're just as bad as the UK police and too intimidated to do a damn thing about it! Now they are gone....and we have NO IDEA what they are planning, whether its suicide bombing or somethng else.

									This morning's Facebook rumor is that the University of Connecticut is building a ""Blacks Only"" dormitory on campus with taxpayer funds. This is supposed to improve the graduation rate for young, black men by enabling them to spend more time with each other. It seems a bit ""hinky"" to me. It's not being covered by any mainstream news outlets, and a visit to UCONN's website, while it reveals several initiatives for Black History Month, doesn't say a word. This looks like it needs some of your famous debunking. For me, it doesn't quite pass the ""sniff test."" There are lots of Google links to be had by searching for ""uconn black dorm,"" but as I said, none seem reliable. Thanks!!

Can anyone be supprised that A Muslim Communist OBAMA would direct the Post Office to do this???

Remember Obama has referred to MY Muslim Religion several times, maybe a Freudian slip, huh???

USPS New 42-Cent Stamp!!! Celebrates Muslim holiday.

If there is only ONE thing you forward today.... let it be this!
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of Pan Am Flight 103!
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993!
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the Marine Barracks in Lebanon !
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the military Barracks in Saudi Arabia !
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the American Embassies in Africa !
REMEMBER the MUSLIM bombing of the USS COLE!
REMEMBER the MUSLIM attack on 9/11/2001 !
REMEMBER all the AMERICAN lives that were lost in those vicious MUSLIM attacks!

Now President Obama has directed the United States Postal Service to REMEMBER and HONOR the EID MUSLIM holiday season with a new commemorative 42 Cent First Class Holiday Postage Stamp..

REMEMBER to adamantly &amp; vocally BOYCOTT this stamp, when you are purchasing your stamps at the post office.

All you have to say is ""No thank you, I do not want that Muslim Stamp on my letters!""
To use this stamp would be a slap in the face to all those AMERICANS who died at the hands of those whom this stamp honors.

REMEMBER ~
Pass this along to every Patriotic AMERICAN that you know and let's get the word out !!!

Here is something to chew on...
They (MUSLIMS) don't even believe in Christ, &amp; they're getting their own Christmas stamp! BUT, don't dare to dream of posting the ten commandments on federal property! This is truly UNBELIEVABLE !!!

									This is going around the internet.

I've noticed some facebook posts about fast-food chains (KFC, McDonalds are examples) offering free 'lifetime-passes' — or that is to say, free food for a lifetime. Seems to be a hoax, an attempt to get the unsuspecting to click on a link, then they get malware (or something worse) on their computer. The http link does not look legit — it has KFC as the first characters, but the rest looks suspicious (kfc-comz753760o.luckies.xyz).

The post contains restaurant logos, and a bar code, like a coupon. The KFC example also says 'Get Yours now & Enjoy Free KFC for lifetime'. The bad grammar also sends up a flag.

									Sen. David Perdue is the junior senator from Georgia. He's known in the Senate as a nice, modest guy — not one of the bomb throwers, by any means.

Here is how the prayer he encouraged the audience to make for Obama continues:

Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.

Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.

Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.

Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.																			Collected via e-mail, June 2016",,14/06/2016,15082,1,"[106914, 116875, 124373, 127669]"

I don't think this is a good idea at all !!! I think we should write our congressperson!

This is not good but I thought I should pass it along. Check your drivers license. Now you can see anyone's Driver's License on the Internet, including your own! I just searched for mine and there it was ... picture and all!! Thanks Homeland Security! Where are our rights?

I definitely removed mine. I suggest you do the same... Go to the web site and check it out. Just enter your name, city and state to see if yours is on file.

Are you a Non- Smoker or Against smoking all together ?
Do you ever wonder why you have to have your coffee every morning?

** TIM HORTON'S SHOCKER **

A man from Arkansas came up to Canada for a visit only to find himself in the hospital after a couple of days. Doctor's told him that he had suffered of cardiac arrest. He was allergic to Nicotine. The man did not understand why that would of happened as he does not smoke knowing full well he was allergic to Nicotine. He told the doctor that he had not done anything different while he was on vacation other than having Tim Horton's coffee. The man then went back to Tim Horton's and asked what was in their coffee. Tim Horton's refuses to divulge that information. After threatening legal action, Tim Horton's finally admitted.....

*** THERE IS NICOTINE IN TIM HORTON'S COFFEE ***

A girl I know was on the patch to quit smoking. After a couple of days she was having chest pains & was rushed to the hospital. The doctor told her that she was on a Nicotine overload. She swore up & down that she had not been smoking. SHE WAS HAVING HER COFFEE EVERY MORNING.

Now imagine a women who quits smoking because she finds out that she is pregnant, but still likes to have her Tim Horton's once in a while.

There aren't many people on this earth that would say they've heard of the small town of Buffalo, but Tom Cruise is one of them. Buffalo is a small town in Missouri located just around thirty miles outside of the larger city of Springfield. It's a peaceful town, tranquil and filled with many friendly locales who rarely leave the town in fear that civilization might gobble them up. Tom Cruise announced today in an interview that he was ""tired of all the bright lights and paparazzi"" and that he wanted ""a new beginning."" He recently visited Buffalo after getting lost on his way to a bar. ""Everything is so orderly there."" Tom told People magazine in a recent interview, ""The people all wear the same clothes, drive the same trucks, and shop at the same Walmart.....it's beautiful.""

Tom says one of the main aspects of the town drawing him in is the amazing food selection available. He visited a small chinese restaurant known as ""Sims"" and claimed it was the best food he'd ever had. ""I unloaded my bowels violently for days"" Mr Cruise told us in a phone interview, ""The food must be loaded with fiber and many other healthy nutrients."" He is excited to try the town's two other restaurant options; Pizza Hut and Hip Pocket Pizza. Tom told interviewers it looked like most other business' were closed down, but was hoping his presence in the town would boost the local economy",,27/07/2016,16387,0,"[114640, 125989]"

									Proposed on the senate floor on December 5th 2016, SB -18 the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth in California, would give the state of California the right to take away your child if ‘they’ deem necessary.

Dr. Richard Pan, the pediatrician behind SB277, the CA bill that removed vaccination exemptions from thousands of California families is at it again. Apparently he feels that if his agenda is not met, then the state has a better chance of raising your child then you do!

Here is the overview of the proposed bill…. But please read carefully as this bill has very loosely defined terms as to what is a “right” and what could easily be manipulated to make a case for confiscating your child!

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL’S DIGEST

SB 18, as introduced, Pan. Bill of Rights for Children and Youth in California.
Existing law provides for the care and welfare of children and youth in various contexts, including, but not limited to, child welfare services, foster care, health care, nutrition, homeless assistance, and education.
Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 80 (Res. Ch. 101, Stats. 2009) declares the Legislature’s support of a Bill of Rights for the Children and Youth of California that resolves to invest in all children and youth in order to achieve specified goals to create an optimal environment for their healthy development.
This bill would declare the intent of the Legislature to expand and codify the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California to establish a comprehensive framework that governs the rights of all children and youth in California, outlines the research-based essential needs of California’s children, and establishes standards relating to the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and familial supports necessary for all children to succeed.
The bill would declare the intent of the Legislature, by January 1, 2022, to enact legislation for the purpose of ensuring that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.

BILL TEXT

THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

SECTION 1.

(a) The Legislature finds and declares that all children and youth, regardless of gender, class, race, ethnicity, national origin, culture, religion, immigration status, sexual orientation, or ability, have inherent rights that entitle them to protection, special care, and assistance, including, but not limited to, the following:

(1) The right to parents, guardians, or caregivers who act in their best interest.
(2) The right to form healthy attachments with adults responsible for their care and well-being.
(3) The right to live in a safe and healthy environment.
(4) The right to social and emotional well-being.
(5) The right to opportunities to attain optimal cognitive, physical, and social development.
(6) The right to appropriate, quality education and life skills leading to self-sufficiency in adulthood.
(7) The right to appropriate, quality health care.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to expand and codify the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California created by Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 80 (Res. Ch. 101, Stats. 2009), to establish a comprehensive framework that governs the rights of all children and youth in California, outlines the research-based essential needs of California’s children, and establishes standards relating to the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and familial supports necessary for all children to succeed.

SEC. 2.

It is the intent of the Legislature, by January 1, 2022, to enact appropriate legislation to accomplish all of the following:

(a) Develop and put forth research-based policy solutions that will ensure the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.
(b) Determine the amount of revenue and resources necessary to ensure that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.
(c) Identify and obtain the revenue and resources necessary to ensure that the Bill of Rights for Children and Youth of California, in its totality, is applied evenly, equitably, and appropriately to all children and youth across the state.

Many across the state are already calling this the “The Destruction of Family Act, or The Medical Kidnap Act, or The Government Owns Your Children Act.”
The website, Age of Autism, asks, “Why would a state, in the United States of America, have to enact legislation to ensure what the Constitution already protects – life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?”
Read this closely again. Who decides what “acting in a child’s best interest” means? Or what is “appropriate” healthcare?
This is very frightening and downright scary news to any parent in the state of California. Imagine for a minute that someone shows up at your door and physically takes your children out of your home? And for what reason? They didn’t go to the dentist? They didn’t get their latest flu shot? Perhaps you homeschool your child and the state doesn’t think you are doing a good job.
Many parents across social media are already calling this the ‘most destructive’ family based bill to ever hit the floor of the California senate. Some parents are even calling for immediate removal of Senator Pan from his senate seat.
One parent comments, “The lines of the California state senate and the endorsement deals that Senator Pan has made with various pharmaceutical companies are completely blurred. “

One could say that this senator has been ‘bought’ and is nothing more than a ‘whipping boy’ for whatever drug company that decides to write him a check to endorse their latest products.”

Unfortunately, this may actually be the truth. According to Health Impact News,
“Pharmaceutical companies and their trade groups gave more than $2 million to current members of the Legislature in 2013-2014, about 2 percent of the total raised, records show. Nine of the top 20 recipients are either legislative leaders or serve on either the Assembly or Senate health committees. Receiving more than $95,000, the top recipient of industry campaign cash is Sen. Richard Pan, a Sacramento Democrat and doctor who is carrying the vaccine bill.

In addition, the industry donated more than $500,000 to outside campaign spending groups that helped elect some current members last year.

Pharmaceutical companies also spent nearly $3 million more during the 2013-2014 legislative session lobbying the Legislature, the governor, the state pharmacists’ board and other agencies, according to state filings. (Source.)”

What do you think about this? Are you concerned that if this bill should pass that you would lose your rights to your child? That this bill would in essence be an infringement on your rights as a parent to your child?

									This story needs to go viral. It is a little long but what this mother experienced here in Rochester needs to get out to the public fast so it does not happen to anyone else. Please share.

Im going to share the scariest moment of my life to spread awareness that this is in our community and in our lives.

This happened on July 4th 2016 Silver Lake Park In Rochester, MN at the fire work show.

My family and I attended the fire work show with one of my closest friends and her children. We walked along the path next to the graveyard and river to get there and found a spot right next to the stage, immediately my youngest, their dad myself and 2 others went to get some concessions for the show. I left my daughter Amora with my friend and her other 2 kids.

I got a text from her saying ""Amora wants mom and dad"". We returned and the show had already started. Took our seats and watched the show. After the finale a stage lit up and a young man started singing catchy songs- this immediately caught all of our attentions and we were like lets go! Our boyfriends didn't feel the same and wanted to walk home before the crowds started pouring out. We separated and headed to the stage with our total 5 children to join the fun. Our kids were LOVING the show, dancing, singing , jumping with joy so i took out my phone to record the fun. As i was recording i put my phone down because i noticed out of 300+ people there was ONE man who stuck out. He was a 40-50 year old Arab man who was standing completely still, right behind my daughter. He looked blank in every way possible. He noticed that i had noticed him and we locked eyes, i pulled my 4 year old away from him and she was upset that i had taken her view of the stage away so she started dancing again. Then he was right behind her again, but this time he pulled out his phone and took her picture, i launched at him and he started to walk away but as he walked away from me he grabbed Amora's head to see if she would willingly come with him. NO WAY i ran after this man. I screamed for him and he pretended not to hear me, i finally touched him and he turned around. I yelled at him and tried to take his phone he replied "" sorry she is just so beautiful with a disgusting SMIRK on his face, then out of the dark path way two older men ( also middle eastern ) emerged and stood behind him firmly. I screamed at him for touching my daughter and demanded the phone back, i told him i was calling the cops he said ""OO so scary"" in a mocking tone. I then got furious and said their dad was going to beat the crap out of them, he responded with "" he is not here though"" immediately i became panicked they had been watching us, i was thinking there was more of them in the group and turned around to get my babies. After this incident we got the hell out of there. My friend and i took our babies and got home, we then talked about what had happened. I found it SO odd that she texted me ""Amora wants her mom and Dad"" she had sent me that text because the older 2 arab men that appeared from the dark path had been sitting behind us the entire show. With their videos out and acting in strange matter that made her feel extremely uncomfortable with their pacing and their watching . They had watched our men walk away and sent the 3rd man into the crowd with us. It was so busy and noisy no one even noticed me screaming at this man, not one single person. And believe me i was SCREAMING at him trying to cause a scene. I called the police to report what happened because i have been a MESS since that night and i cannot get myself together mentally. The police and i went over the entire story and they confirmed it was 100% a kidnapping attempt, these men sell little girls into sex trafficking. I cannot explain how hard this is to even type for me but i hope it helps others. This IS REAL. This happened where i have been watching fire works for 24 years in ""small rochester""

They go to big events so they go unnoticed
They target women without men and force them into situations where they are separated
They try to make a bond with your child to lure them willingly without a scene if possible.
They work in groups of 3 or more
They take your children and sell them into sex trafficking.

No i am not okay, and i wont be for a very long time. Had i not noticed what was going on- my baby girl would be gone forever. I cant stomach that one bit- i have been getting help and come home a giant mess every single day and have almost now called into work all week due to have anxiety. Every time i look at her i cry. It was bath night last night and i crawled in the bath with her and cried and she is very confused what is wrong with me. This post i hope is shared by many and taken very seriously.

									Aren't statistics wonderful? 'Guns don't kill people, doctors do.'

Doctors:

(A) The number of physicians in the U.S. is 700,000.

(B) Accidental deaths caused by Physicians per year are 120,000.

(C) Accidental deaths per physician is 0.171

Statistics courtesy of U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services.

---------------------------------------

Now think about this:

Guns:

(A) The number of gun owners in the U.S. is 80,000,000. (Yes, that's 80 million)

(B) The number of accidental gun deaths per year, all age groups, is 1,500.

(C) The number of accidental deaths per gun owner is .0000188

Statistics courtesy of FBI

---------------------------------------

So, statistically, doctors are approximately 9,000 times more dangerous than gun owners.

Remember, 'Guns don't kill people, doctors do.'

FACT: NOT EVERYONE HAS A GUN, BUT Almost everyone has at least one doctor.

This means you are over 9,000 times more likely to be killed by a doctor as by a gun owner!!!

Please alert your friends to this alarming threat. We must ban doctors before this gets completely out of hand!!!!!

Out of concern for the public at large, we withheld the statistics on lawyers for fear the shock would cause people to panic and seek medical attention!

									CZECH PRAGUE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE --

An article in the Prague newspaper, Prager Zeitungon:

""The danger to America is not Barack Obama, but a citizenry capable of entrusting a man like him with the Presidency. It will be far easier to limit and undo the follies of an Obama presidency than to restore the necessary common sense and good judgment to a depraved electorate willing to have such a man for their president. The problem is much deeper and far more serious than Mr. Obama, who is a mere symptom of what ails America . Blaming the prince of fools should not blind anyone to the vast confederacy of fools that made him their prince. The Republic can survive a Barack Obama, who is, after all, merely a fool.

									This is supposed to be a photo of the Obamas at a White House state dinner, but I doubt it.   Is this an old picture from a Halloween party or something?





I received this photo in an email captioned White House Ball. Is this for real? Or is it a a photo some one has tampered with to make it look this way?



This picture was emailed with the comment: ""Sometimes I miss Barbara and Laura Bush — and Jackie Kennedy in her little a-line dresses with matching hat and gloves!"" Is it real or retouched?



Is this the Obamas' 'actual' wedding photo?



This was sent to me by an old ex-neighbor who wound up being a White House photographer. She said that after the Ball some fashion critics suggested that the attire could be questioned by some and therefore a lid was put on all photographs. This one happened to make it to my email, however, and I'm passing it along to a few.""
