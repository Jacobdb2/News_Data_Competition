## Directory

- project_data.ipynb
    - This file cleans the data that we are given and creates 2 pickle files. 1 pickle file represents the dataframe that holds information such as (claims, claimant, dates, labels, related article array). The other picke file holds the dataframe for the related articles, indexed by the respective article ID.
    - This file will take 30-40 minutes to run, as it stems, removes stopwords, tokenizes all claims and related articles as well as some basic claimant and date cleaning.

- project_template.ipynb
    - This is a template file. It shows how to read the 2 pickle files generated by project_data.ipynb
    - There are some sample codes here to show how to work with the two dataframes

- with_NN.ipynb
    - This file holds some preliminary results on our neural network implementation

- with_sentiment.ipynb
    - This file holds some preliminary results on our sentiment analysis implementation

- EDA.ipynb
    - this file currently holds some EDA on the dates and claimants
        - the EDA includes graphs on relationships between dates and the label (True, false, partly true)

- train.csv
    - this is a file generated based on train.json which is something given to us from the competition
